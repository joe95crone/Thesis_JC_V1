\section{Motivation for a CBETA Inverse Compton Scattering Source}

The CBETA ERL is the first demonstration of an SRF multi-pass ERL \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}, which enables a compact accelerator to provide 100's~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron beams with small emittance ($\epsilon_{n} < 1$~\si{\milli\meter}-\si{\milli\radian}) and small relative energy spread whilst delivering high electron beam power ($P_{\mathrm{avg}} = 6$~\si{\mega\watt}). These factors contribute to a high-quality, high-brillance electron beam which is an ideal driver of an inverse Compton source. Consequently, an x-ray light source can be designed to harness CBETA and provide high-quality x-ray beams within a compact footprint. Another advantage of using a multi-pass ERL to drive an ICS source is that ICS sources can be constructed to use each of the four nominal energies of the CBETA accelerator, therefore a multi-colour radiation source is possible. 

The maximum electron beam energy of the CBETA at 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} enables production of x-rays with a minimum wavelength of $\lambda = 0.03$~\si{\angstrom} ($E_{\gamma} = 402$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}), extending the reach of current synchrotron facilities which are limited to the $E_{\gamma} = 300$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} range, as demonstrated later in this section. A smaller wavelength enables new applications such as tomography of thick specimens and non-resonant inelastic scattering (NIXS) of transition metal oxides -- of relevance to development of high temperature superconductors \cite{isaacs1996resonant}.
 
Inherent in the inverse Compton scattering process is a correspondence between photon energy and scattering angle ($E_{\gamma} \propto \theta$), therefore simple collimation is adequate to select a bandwidth of photons from a source. This is even possible once geometric bunch--pulse effects are accounted for. However, this is in contrast to synchrotron and bremmsstrahlung sources, where complicated optical arrangements, like monochromators, are required to select a user specified photon bandwidth. Therefore, compact ICS sources may have an additional advantage of less complex experimental optics for users in comparison to similar x-ray production methods. 
 
Production of narrow-bandwidth radiation is plausible using an ERL ICS source, evidenced by inspection of (Eq.~\ref{eq:RMS_bandwidth}), as ERLs such as CBETA have small energy spread and are capable of very small emittances ($\epsilon_{n} = 0.3$~\si{\milli\meter}-\si{\milli\radian}). Therefore, operation and design of a CBETA inverse Compton scattering source would be informative toward design of narrow-band radiation sources in the $\gamma$-ray regime ($E_{\gamma} > 1$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}). On the \si{\mega\electronvolt}-scale only the bremsstrahlung process is competitive with ICS as a high-flux source, yet bremsstrahlung suffers from a broad bandwidth and in the $\gamma$-ray regime monochromation is less feasible.

In summary, ERLs combine the best of both types of accelerators; they can typically deliver higher-quality beams than those in storage rings, with greater energy efficiency than a linac \cite{smith2006optic}. Therefore, as the beam parameters necessary for scientific research call for higher current and higher quality beams, ERLs are the accelerators best-suited to meet this demand. Multi-turn ERLs, which accelerate the electron beam multiple times before decelerating the beam, have the benefit of being able to reach higher energies without additional cost, power requirements, or floor space \cite{merminga2003high}. Inverse Compton scattering sources benefit from both the high current and high quality electron beams delivered by ERLs which translates into high flux, narrow bandwidth ICS sources desired by users. 

\section{ERL Electron Beam and Optical Cavity Laser Pulse Parameters}

Electron bunch parameters for the CBETA inverse Compton scattering source are conducive to a high brightness electron beam with a low energy spread which is necessary to meet design goals of a high flux, high average brilliance x-ray source with narrow-bandwidth capabilities. For a large flux, a smaller electron beam spot size at the IP is needed; while a larger spot can be beneficial for a narrower scattered photon bandwidth, though photon bandwidth ultimately depends on the electron beam divergence and energy spread. The electron parameters for the design of the CBETA inverse Compton scattering source are majoritively based on the design parameters of the CBETA ERL as presented in the design report \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta}. However, these are modified with respect to the considerations relevant to an inverse Compton scattering source and the implications of the multi-pass commissioning \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}. The electron bunch parameters have also been subjected to a series of optimisations, as detailed in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}, for premier performance of the CBETA ICS source. The results of these optimisations, limited to the round transverse electron bunch profile, which was the only available optimisation method during this design are described later in this section. A baseline case is also presented where the $\beta$-function at the interaction point remains constant across all nominal energies, with a small electron bunch spot size designed to maximise uncollimated flux and average brilliance. The electron bunch parameters of the CBETA ICS source are presented in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters}.  

\begin{table}[!h]
\caption{Electron beam parameters envisaged at the CBETA ICS source interaction point (IP). Both baseline and optimised parameters assume a round transverse profile for the electron bunch. The given baseline parameters -- which assume the same $\beta^*$ at the IP -- allow a comparison of flux and bandwidth at different energies. The RB optimised values beneath those correspond to maximal flux into a 0.5\% \textit{rms} scattered photon bandwidth.}

The design of the CBETA ERL \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta} allows for a maximum bunch charge of 123~\si{\pico\coulomb} whilst the bunch charge assumed in this design is 32~\si{\pico\coulomb}, a factor $\sim$~4 lower. Reduction in bunch charge is necessitated because the coherent synchrotron radiation disruption of the beam imposes a limit on the bunch charge of 32~\si{\pico\coulomb} \cite{lou2020coherent}. The specification of a 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz} repetition frequency, subject to the optical re-circulation cavity limitations, also means that the average beam current is instantly halved from the design values irrespective of the bunch charge limitations. The maximum average beam current of the CBETA ERL design is 40~\si{\milli\ampere}, this is reduced to 5.2~\si{\milli\ampere} average beam current for operation of the CBETA ICS source. The 5.2~\si{\milli\ampere} average beam current is well within the theoretical current limitations of the beam break-up instability (BBU), simulated to be beyond 40~\si{\milli\ampere} in 98\% of simulations and beyond 1~\si{\milli\ampere} in every simulation performed for the CBETA ERL \cite{lou2019beam}.   

The electron bunch duration of the CBETA ICS at the IP is within the picosecond domain, comparable to other ERLs \cite{angal2018perle} and ERL ICS projects such as the cERL ICS \cite{akagi2016narrow}. Therefore, with similar laser pulse duration as shown in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}, the scattered radiation is produced with picosecond-scale duration. As the laser pulse duration in the Fabry-Perot cavitt is larger, minimisation of the electron bunch length via magnetic bunch compression would not produce a smaller scattered photon but magnetic bunch compression could increase the complexity of the design and, due to bunch length--energy spread correlation, could increase the bandwidth of the scattered radiation.   

Single-turn commissioning of the CBETA ERL successfully demonstrated the operation of the FFA return beamline with electron beams in an energy range from 39 to 59~\si{\mega\electronvolt} \cite{gulliford2019beam,gulliford2021measurement}. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the CBETA ERL could be operated within this range to generate ICS photons from the first turn configuration. This would allow production of scattered photons with continuously tuneable energy in the range 27.8 to 63.0~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. Extending the argument to the demonstrated 4-turn configuration \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}, Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_energy_tuning} indicates the possible scattered photon energies using either the nominal energies of the 4 passes, or from the tuneable electron kinetic energy of a single pass. Since tuning of the scattered photon energy of inverse Compton scattering sources is most practical by the variation of the electron beam kinetic energy, Fig~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_energy_tuning} is indicative of the likely scattered photon energy tuning range at the CBETA ICS which would be analogous to those at other multi-pass ERL facilities.  

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{An ICS source generating photons from each of the four CBETA ERL passes delivers the (fixed) scattered energies indicated here; we assume a fixed incident laser wavelength of 1064~\si{\nano\meter}. CBETA has also experimentally demonstrated tuning of single-pass acceleration from 39 to 59~\si{\mega\electronvolt} (indicated by the shaded region), which indicates the continuous tuning of scattered photon energy that an ERL in general might deliver.}

\end{figure}

The round beam optimisation of the CBETA ICS, as explained in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}, for the $\beta$-function at the IP $\beta^{*}$ and collimation angle $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ trade-off of a 0.5\% \textit{rms} narrow bandwidth case are shown in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters}. These optimised parameters are the optimum electron bunch interaction point $\beta$-function and collimation angle for maximising the collimated flux of the CBETA ICS into the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth. Variables are quoted for a 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth of the scattered radiation because this is an adequate demonstration of a narrow-band ICS source ($\left(\Delta E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}\right)_{\mathrm{rms}} < 1$). The methodology in Section~\ref{sec:RB_optimisation}, when applied to a series of \textit{rms} bandwidths in the range 0--1\%, produces a tuning curve within the $\beta^{*}-\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ parameter space of the CBETA ICS corresponding to the maximal collimated flux solutions, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design/CBETA_COMBINED_beta_theta.pdf}
\caption{Tuning curves of $\beta^{*}$ against $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ for each of the nominal CBETA electron beam energies satisfying the maximal flux across the 0--1\% \textit{rms} bandwidth range. The shaded area is the parameter space, while the line corresponds to the maximal flux solution for a given \textit{rms} bandwidth. Minimised bandwidth solutions in this range have large $\beta$-functions at the IP and small collimation angles $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$; the maximal bandwidth solutions have small $\beta$-functions and larger collimation angles $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$.}
\label{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space}
\end{figure}

Each of the tuning curves (for each nominal energy) of the $\beta^{*}-\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ parameter spaces in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space} has a distinctive 'elbow' shape - a near-linear regime followed by a non-linear regime. The Pareto-optimal parameter space front shows a linear relationship as the collimation angle increases, this part is dominated by the emittance term, until a vertex is reached and, as collimation angle increases, there is a non-linear shape where the Pareto front is dominated by the collimation term. The termination of the Pareto fronts at the small collimation angle marks the point in which the optimal $\beta$-function at the IP becomes imaginary. Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space} clearly shows an energy dependence upon the optimal $\beta$-functions at the IP and the collimation angles, consequently the interaction region optics and collimation of a multi-colour ICS source must be variable for optimum performance across a range of bandwidths. 

The laser pulse and Fabry-Perot optical cavity parameters of the CBETA ICS source are specified in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}. For the CBETA ICS, a Nd:YAG ($\lambda=1064$~\si{\nano\meter}) laser is specified, which is enhanced and re-circulated by a Fabry-Perot optical cavity. The laser pulse parameters within the optical cavity are based on the Fabry-Perot optical cavity demonstrated in the cERL inverse Compton scattering source \cite{akagi2016narrow}. An identical bow-tie 4-mirror planar cavity is envisioned for the CBETA ICS, a full design of a Fabry-Perot optical cavity was foreseen as beyond the scope of this source design. Focus within this work is on design of electron accelerators toward high flux, narrow bandwidth ICS sources not on laser system design for ICS sources.

A Nd:YAG laser ($\lambda = 1064$~\si{\nano\meter}) is specified for the CBETA ICS as Nd:YAG lasers typically hava a narrow spectral bandwidth in comparison to other possible interactions lasers, such as Ti:Sa lasers, and Nd:YAG lasers are widely available. Longer wavelength lasers, such as a CO$_{2}$ laser \cite{pogorelsky2020converting} ($\lambda = 10.6$~\si{\micro\meter}), have incident photons of lower energy and therefore for an invariant pulse energy there is a higher photon density in the interacted pulse, which in turn increases the flux of the ICS source. However, the desire for higher energy x-rays makes a Nd:YAG laser with a 1064~\si{\nano\meter} wavelength preferable for this design. In addition, for a high repetition rate of inverse Compton scattering interactions it is necessary to have re-circulation of the laser pulse which requires high-finesse optical mirrors which have been developed more thoroughly in the infrared regime and power limitations on optical cavities exist, which would negate the benefit of using longer wavelength lasers. 

The Fabry-Perot optical cavity repetition rate of the CBETA ICS is set at 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz} because this is the highest repetition rate that has been demonstrated within the ERL environment \cite{akagi2016narrow}. A repetition rate of 325~\si{\mega\hertz} would be ideal as this would allow operation at the nominal CBETA ERL bunch repetition rate \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta}. However, in this domain total path length of the cavity (for a single pulse configuration) must be 0.92~\si{\meter} for a 325~\si{\mega\hertz} cavity in comparison to 1.84~\si{\meter} at 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz}, which presents engineering challenges such as misalignment of the cavity mirrors and an inevitably larger crossing angle for a planar cavity. Therefore, the more conservative choice of a 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz} interaction repetition rate was selected. The repetition rate of the electron bunches must also match this ratio, hence why the CBETA ERL is limited to half of the original design bunch repetition rate. 

An Nd:YAG laser typically operates with picosecond \textit{rms} pulse duration, here specified as 10~\si{\pico\second} which is ideal for the CBETA ICS source as this is well matched to the 3.33~\si{\pico\second} electron bunch duration. Picosecond scale pulse duration is advantageous because it diminishes the effect of the hourglass and angular crossing effects \cite{miyahara2008luminosity}, whilst also avoiding the timing complexity for the ICS interaction that would be associated with shorter durations. With invariant average laser power, shorter laser pulse durations would also increase the peak power of the laser upon the Fabry-Perot cavity mirrors increasing the possibility of surface hot-spot defects, which reduce average stored power in the optical cavity \cite{wang2020prior}. In addition, the 10~\si{\pico\second} laser pulse duration reflects the pulse duration used in the state-of-the-art 670~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power optical cavity demonstration with a 1040~\si{\nano\meter} wavelength laser \cite{carstens2014megawatt}.     

An \textit{rms} spot size at the IP of 25~\si{\micro\meter} is proposed as this has been experimentally demonstrated on the cERL ICS experiment \cite{akagi2016narrow}. The cavity used in the cERL experiment also involved a 5\si{\degree} crossing angle, with crossing angles on the degree scale common in many ICS source designs \cite{faillace2019status,variola2014thomx}, hence a 5\si{\degree} crossing angle is specified for the CBETA ICS. The proposed spectral bandwidth (relative energy spread of the laser pulse) is not directly stated within the cERL paper \cite{akagi2016narrow}, however based on the pulse duration of the laser, the characteristic small spectral bandwidth of Nd:YAG lasers and the energy selecting nature of a Fabry-Perot cavity an approximation of a $\Delta \lambda = 0.7$~\si{\nano\meter} \cite{corner2019personal} \textit{rms} wavelength variation is assumed, resulting in a 6.57$\times 10^{-4}$ \textit{rms} spectral bandwidth.     

The Fabry--Perot cavity included within this source design has an average stored power of 10~\si{\kilo\watt}, which is below the state-of-the-art 670~\si{\kilo\watt} stored power demonstration by Carstens et al \cite{carstens2014megawatt}, though this was conducted outside of an accelerator environment. A stable 383~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power demonstration outside of an accelerator environment has also recently been conducted for the ThomX ICS source \cite{liu2018optical}. In terms of operated optical cavities for ICS, the recent demonstration of the Munich Compact Light Source (MuCLS) operated with a 70~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power \cite{eggl2016munich}, therefore our parameters are conservative. 

\section{Bypass Design}
\label{sec:bypass_design}

To utilize CBETA as an inverse Compton scattering source, a bypass line is required due to the stringent space restrictions in the existing FFA system; this leaves no space to arrange IP focusing, nor for the laser re-circulation cavity. The scattered photons from the ICS must also be produced in a different plane to the existing accelerator; the photons must be safely extracted from the footprint of the ERL since there is no space for an experimental hutch within the existing CBETA hall. This is evident upon inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_schematic} the technical schematic of the CBETA accelerator and hall. From this diagram it is also clear that there is no scope to build a bypass line within the same plane as the existing accelerator due to space constraints.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Schematic of the CBETA ERL \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta}; existing accelerator structure including injector, main linac cryomodule, FFAG return loop, splitter and recombiner systems and beam dump, as well as supporting infrastructure such as electronic racks, vaccuum pumps and shielding.}
\label{fig:CBETA_schematic}
\end{figure}

The layout of the designed bypass line is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Layout}, where the ICS bypass replaces the ordinary 4th pass of the CBETA ERL. The bypass is configured for 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th-pass operation but could be adapted to operate with all nominal energies through adjustment of the splitter and recombiner sections of the CBETA ERL; modification of the bypass to lower nominal energies is discussed in more detail at the end of this section. The bypass beamline was designed and optimised using the \textsc{Bmad} accelerator simulation library \cite{BmadManual} and the \textsc{Tao} program \cite{TaoManual} for simulating high
energy particle beams in accelerators.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\label{fig:CBETA_ICS_Layout}
\end{figure}

The designed ICS bypass beamline diverts the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron beam after the 4th linac pass in the corresponding S4 splitter line; the electron beam then re-enters the existing layout in the R4 line. Therefore the bypass replaces the 4th pass of the FFA return loop, the S4 splitter, from the 4th dipole onward and R4 recombiner up to the 4th dipole. The bypass will be located above the existing permanent magnet arc as the original FFA arc transport of CBETA is still used to transport the lower energy (42, 78, and 114~MeV) beams before and after the bypass. For example, for ICS operation of CBETA using the 3rd turn nominal electron bunch energy ($E_{e} = 114$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}), the original FFA arc will be used to transport the first two turns -- the first and second pass as well as the fourth and fifth pass. 

All of the magnets within the CBETA ICS bypass have magnetic field strengths and gradients within the maxima of those already present in the CBETA ERL design. The maximum magnetic field gradient of any quadrupole is below $\sim15$~\si{\tesla}/\si{\meter} and the maximum dipole field used is below $\sim1$~\si{\tesla} which should be easily attainable. Magnet specification is beyond the scope of this design though the field requirements of the ICS bypass magnets may be satisfied via Hallbach permanent quadrupole magnets, as used in the CBETA FFA design or through conventional electromagnets.

A system of vertical doglegs, replacing sections of the S4 and R4 lines where the bypass connects to the existing 4th turn of the CBETA ERL, are required to provide a 30~\si{\centi\meter} vertical elevation of the bypass line relative to the plane of the FFA return loop in order to avoid the existing accelerator. Single step vertical doglegs are preferred over the staircase style vertical doglegs used in the CEBAF spreader \cite{york1987optics}, as they offer a smaller footprint which is desirable in a compact accelerator. However, this comes at the cost of increased dispersion growth and therefore poor $R_{56}$. Increased dispersion growth can be mitigated by additional focusing, though in the CBETA case additional focusing is not required as the vertical doglegs are short enough to limit the impact on $R_{56}$.   
Bypass arc sections using a quasi double bend achromat structure replace the existing FFA arc sections (FA, FB). Following the first arc, there is a horizontal dogleg used to zero horizontal dispersion before the interaction region and offset the bypass from existing infrastructure. 

At the interaction region the beam is again offset upward locally by a further 20~\si{\centi\meter} -- to a 50~\si{\centi\meter} total vertical offset above the FFA reference orbit height -- using a pair of vertical doglegs; named the IR doglegs. The further vertical offset is imposed so the photons are produced in a different plane to both the bypass line and FFA return loop, which is necessary for the extraction of the x-ray beam to an external experimental hutch and to avoid irradiation of the FFA permanent magnets. As electrons circulate clockwise with reference to Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Layout} and the photons are backscattered, an experimental hutch would be placed to the left of this figure ($-x$ direction) where adequate space exists for an experimental end station. Design of the experimental hutch is beyond the scope of this design study. 

A flexible focusing section within the pair of IR doglegs is used to focus to the required beam waist. The final focus section is designed to enable both $\beta^{*} = 1$~\si{\centi\meter} for the baseline case and $\beta^{*} = 12.7$~\si{\centi\meter} for the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth case (see Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters}). Further interaction point conditions require $\alpha_{x/y} =0$ and the dispersion and it's derivative be zeroed ($\eta_{x/y} = 0$, $\eta'_{x/y} = 0$). The condition for $\alpha_{x/y} = 0$ arises from the design of the low $\beta$ insertion and zereoed dispersion is necessary for the production of quasi-monochromatic scattered photons. The final focus section is based on a low $\beta$ insertion \cite{chao2013handbook} and is constructed from 7 quadrupoles with the laser re-circulation cavity placed between the adequately separated 4th and 5th quadrupole. Quadrupole triplets are used to focus the bunch to the required small waist for interaction whilst the 7th IR quadrupole is used to aid optics matching of the outgoing interaction vertical dogleg. This scheme allows the photons to be extracted via the first dipole of the downstream IR dogleg, minimizing the number of magnets requiring modification for photon extraction. 

For the 4th pass of CBETA, the total path length must be altered by $(n+1/2)\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ so the electron beam is decelerated in the subsequent pass. Small adjustments are typically made to the path length by the splitter/recombiner lines, however in the bypass design these have been bisected and can not accomplish this task. Therefore within the straight section of the bypass following the IR, variable path length adjustment is implemented based on the moving chicane described by H. Owen et al~\cite{owen2012modular}; this 4-dipole focusing chicane uses two mechanically-adjustable swing arms each incorporating a quadrupole triplet, and a central bellows. The path length adjustment chicane is introduced to replicate the function of the S4/R4 splitter/recombiners to allow variation of both $R_{56}$ and path length for re-entry into the MLC. Path length adjustment is made by opening the swing arms of the chicane whilst increasing the dipole strengths accordingly. With this system a path length adjustment of $\pm\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ is possible, which corresponds to 180\si{\degree} of linac phase; more than adequate for adjustment of the bypass line. Over a change in path length of $\pm\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ the variation in Twiss values (after re-matching) is moderate, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Twiss}.

After path length adjustment there is a short $\sim5$~\si{\metre} transport section before the second arc. The second arc has a smaller radius of curvature than the first arc, but maintains dipole bending using reasonable strength magnets $B < 1$~\si{\tesla}. Again, the second arc is constructed using a similar quasi double bend achromat design to the first arc. After the arc there is a vertical dogleg which reverses the 30~\si{\centi\meter} offset of the bypass line re-introducing the electron bunch to the plane of the existing CBETA ERL whilst also zeroing the vertical dispersion. The vertical dogleg, in combination with the existing R4 splitter magnets are used to match the optics of the bypass to the pre-existing Twiss parameters and zero horizontal and vertical dispersion of the original 4th turn linac re-entry, hence the further decelerating passes remain unchanged from the original CBETA ERL configuration.   

The quality of the optical matching of the bypass is limited by the compact layout of CBETA, the conditions required for energy recovery of the interacted beam, re-entry from the bypass to the 5th linac pass (Twiss matching, $R_{56} =0$), and the necessity for the bypass to be constructed above the existing FFA return loop though the maximum $\beta$-functions and dispersion remain feasible throughout the ICS bypass. In the worst case scenario, a maximum $\beta$-function of $\beta_{y} = 150$~\si{\meter} is encountered, resulting in a 0.4~\si{\milli\meter} bunch radius which can be accounted for by the standard 35~\si{\milli\meter} CBETA beam pipe radius. The dispersion in the $x$-plane has a maximum of $\eta_{x}\sim5$~\si{\meter} which is tolerable. This bypass design is intended as a proof of principle design, where further iterations could improve upon transport in the bypass. Plots of $\beta$-functions and dispersion in the bypass line for the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth case are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Twiss} and~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_dispersion}.

A Gaussian bunch based on the CBETA ERL parameters at the exit of the linac on the 4th pass has been tracked using \textsc{Tao} from the exit of the linac, around the bypass lattice, to the IP and to the re-entry into the linac on the 5th pass. The tracking simulation was conducted neglecting collective effects such as coherent synchrotron radiation, with no large distortions of the electron distribution observed. At the IP the Gaussian pulse shape is retained; the electron bunch distribution at the IP has been used in analysing the spectrum at the IP using the \textsc{ICCS3D} spectrum code \cite{krafft2016laser,ranjan2018simulation}.   

The ICS bypass design for the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th turn could be generalised to the lower energy turns to form configurable ICS sources from each nominal energy. In this scheme, electron bunches would be re-routed through the S4 line, magnet strengths would be scaled and re-matched, the optimised IP focusing solution for each line, as in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters} would be adhered to, and the path length correction system would be adjusted to satisfy path length and $R_{56}$ constraints. Demonstration of a $\pm\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ path length adjustment for the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th turn means greater flexibility for $\pm\lambda_{RF}$ adjustment at lower nominal energies is possible.

The 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} nominal energy is beamline is at first glance the most challenging as this requires the highest gradient magnets for focusing at the IP, path length correction and transport. However, with a common transport ERL there is added complexity as beamlines are traversed twice in both acceleration and deceleration configuration. For example, the 3rd pass 114~\si{\mega\electronvolt} nominal energy transport line is traversed on both the 3rd turn (accelerating pass) and the 5th turn (decelerating pass). As the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th turn beamline is the maximum energy of the CBETA ERL, in standard 4-turn operation it is only traversed once, in a decelerating configuration which means this complexity is removed.

Added complexity occurs because more transverse and longitudinal matching conditions must be satisfied. For example, if the ERL is still operated in 4-turn mode whilst the ICS source aims to operate using the 3rd turn 114~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch, which in our convention is named '\textit{full turn ICS operation}', the bypass line must simultaneously be able to provide the electron bunch in an accelerating configuration into the linac on the 4th pass ($E_{e} = 150$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) i.e the 1st decelerating pass, whilst also being able to provide the electron bunch into the linac on the 6th pass ($E_{e} = 78$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) in a decelerating configuration. It is traversed twice and can not be varied within this time. In addition, whilst satisfying the optical matching constraints the bunch properties and focusing at the IP must remain identical, otherwise the spectral characteristics of the radiation produced will vary which is not ideal for light source operation. However, the large amount of conditions imposed upon 'full turn  

Alternatively, the ERL could be operated as a 3-turn ERL for the purpose of an ICS at the 3rd nominal energy, which in our convention is named '\textit{reduced turn ICS operation}'. A decelerating configuration bunch is interacted at the IP meaning the produced radiation is identical for each interaction. Sufficient flexibility would be required within this bypass line as the bypass would have to replicate the matching conditions of the 2nd nominal energy decelerating pass and perform a 180\si{\degree} phase change whilst meeting the optimised ICS UP focusing requirements and $R_{56}$ conditions. There may also be implications for injection and linac operation with respect to achieving the an identical repetition frequency in 3-turn operation, as the optical cavity is fixed to a repetition frequency. This approach would be applicable to lower energy, for example if the 2nd turn nominal energy ($E_{e} = 78$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) was desired for ICS operation the ERL would need to be operated as a 2-turn ERL etc. 

The author favours \textit{reduced turn ICS operation} as common transport systems in ERLs are already typically highly constrained -- more-so for the FFAG multiple energy common transport system in CBETA as shown in Chapter~\ref{CBETA_Multi-Pass_Commissioning} - and the reduced turn ICS operation solution appears to offer less constraints on the beam dynamics. However, discussion of multi-coulour ICS operation from a multi-turn common transport ERL is an area which requires further investigation. Of course, the issue of interaction beamlines being traversed twice could be avoided entirely via the use of single transport, where different transport beamlines are used for both the accelerating and decelerating configuration of each nominal energy of the multi-turn ERL. Ultimately, integrating ICS interaction points or other insertion devices as dedicated user areas into the initial design of an ERL would avoid the complexity of retrofitting user bypasses to the ERL.     

\section{Spectral Output}

In order to determine the performance of the CBETA inverse Compton scattering source, the predicted spectral output of the source -- several measures quantifying the output radiation -- must be characterised using the formulae in Chapter~\ref{Photon_Production_by_Inverse_Compton_Scattering}. Anticipated spectral output of the CBETA inverse Compton scattering source is denoted in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}, where the spectral output of the baseline and the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth round-beam optimised configurations are both shown based upon the electron bunch parameters in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters} and laser pulse parameters in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}. The brilliance and spectral density have been calculated solely for the baseline configuration whereas the collimated flux is only denoted for the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth configuration, as collimation is not specified in the baseline configuration.

The round beam optimisation method developed in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra} is chosen to optimise the CBETA ICS source because, at the time of the CBETA ICS bypass design, RB optimisation was the only developed optimisation methodology. Practical demonstration of the round beam optimisation within an ICS source is consequently favoured for the CBETA ICS design, whereas the NRB optimisation is better demonstrated with the DIANA ICS source in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}. A 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth is selected as this is an appropriate bandwidth for a narrowband source, which is defined as $< 1\%$ \textit{rms} bandwidth.

The collimated flux has been optimised for a 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth and the baseline case focuses at the IP to $\beta^{*} =1$~\si{\centi\meter} for each nominal energy.}

\label{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}
\end{table}

From Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}, it is evident that uncollimated flux varies by around 2\% due to the small effect of the varying electron spot size. Recoil effects are negligible even at the highest electron beam energy $E_{e} = 150$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}, as $X = 2.70\times 10^{-3}$. The number of photons scattered in the interactions are essentially independent of electron energy for a fixed electron spot size at the IP, and this is also similarly evident in the collimated flux at each energy. 

From Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}, we see this deign incorporates a 5\si{\degree} crossing angle of the laser pulse with respect to the electron bunch which is necessary because of the Fabry-Perot optical cavity. The crossing angle causes only a $\sim 1$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} reduction in the Compton edge scattered photon energy in comparison to the head-on case ($\phi = 0$). However, the crossing angle impacts the flux of the source significantly as the effective time over which the incident laser photons may interact with the electrons in the counter propagating bunch is reduced. For the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch the angular crossing results in a factor of $R_{AC} = 5.56$ reduction in luminosity due to a 5\si{\degree} crossing (Eq.~\ref{eq:angular_crossing_factor}) -- a substantial reduction in flux. 

The scattered photon energy of the source in independent of the hourglass effect but the hourglass effect impacts upon the luminosity of the source and therefore the flux; the hourglass effect luminosity reduction (Eq.~\ref{eq:furman_hourglass_reduction}) is $R_{HG} = 0.96$, a 4\% reduction in flux for the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch in a head-on ($\phi=0$) back-scattering arrangement. However, the angular crossing and hourglass effect affect the ICS source simultaneously so the full reduction factor (Eq.~\ref{eq:miyahara_combined_reduction}) must account for both simultaneously, resulting in a factor $R_{ACHG} = 5.57$ reduction for the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch. For the CBETA ICS source, the value of the combined luminosity reduction factor (Eq.~\ref{eq:miyahara_combined_reduction}) is  near-identical to the angular crossing reduction factor (Eq.~\ref{eq:angular_crossing_factor}) as the hourglass effect is suppressed by the reduction in interaction time of the electron bunch and laser pulse. 

Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output} also shows both the peak and average brilliance of the source, which increase with nominal energy due to the $\mathcal{B} \propto \gamma^{2}$ relationship -- which is explicitly shown in (Eq.~\ref{eq:average_brilliance_compact}).  Similarly, the spectral density decreases approximately inversely proportional to the square of the Lorentz factor of the electron beam ($S \propto \frac{1}{\gamma^{2}}$). The proportional relations for spectral density and brilliance (peak and average) are approximate as these performance parameters are dependent on flux, where we see a 2\% increase in collimated flux due to the aforementioned spot size effect. 

By applying the collimated flux maximisation to the parameter space of the round beam optimisation in Section~\ref{sec:RB_optimisation}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space}, the collimated flux--\textit{rms} bandwidth tuning curve of the CBETA ICS within the 0--1\% \textit{rms} bandwidth range can be discerned for each of the four nominal energies of CBETA, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve}. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design/CBETA150_RB_Fcol_BW.pdf}
\caption{Tuning curve of collimated flux against \textit{rms} bandwidth for a 0--1\% \textit{rms} bandwidth range, produced by a round beam optimisation which tunes $\beta^{*}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$. The tuning curve is independent of beam energy for scattering scenarios within the Thomson regime, hence this tuning curve applies to all energies in CBETA. The left end of tuning curve indicates the minimum possible \textit{rms} bandwidth of the ICS source, which in CBETA is $\simeq$~0.12\% and is determined by the electron beam and laser pulse energy spreads.}
\label{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve}, the round beam optimisation tuning curves of the four nominal energies of the CBETA ICS are shown as a single line because the recoil parameter for the CBETA ICS is near-negligible ($X<0.003$\% ) for the nominal operating energies of CBETA, which means the tuning curves directly overlap. The tuning curve is independent of energy, as the energy mediates the relationship of the variables ($\beta^{*}$, $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$) through the two dominant terms of the bandwidth (Eq.~\ref{eq:RMS_bandwidth}) -- the collimation term (Eq.~\ref{eq:collimation_term}) and the emittance term (Eq.~\ref{eq:emittance_term}) -- which have similar $\gamma^{2}$ dependences. The relationship between collimated flux and bandwidth for the CBETA ICS is linear beyond the non-linear rapid fall-off at low bandwidth, which is occurs once we approach the minimum theoretical limit of the bandwidth (Eq.~\ref{eq:bandwidth_limitation_minimum}). Within the non-linear portion of Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve}, the energy spreads of the electron bunch and laser pulse dominate the bandwidth, which severely restricts the round beam $\beta^{*}$--$\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ parameter space. Consequently, the optimum balance between the emittance and collimation term can not be achieved, causing a rapid decrease in the collimated flux.

The spectrum of the scattered x-rays produced from a single head-on ($\phi = 0$) CBETA ICS interaction of a 150~\Si{\mega\electrnvolt} electron bunch and laser pulse, collimated downstream into a 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth, with electron bunch and laser pulse parameters presented in Tables~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters} and \ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking}. The spectrum in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking} is produced using two individual semi-analytical spectrum codes: \textsc{ICARUS}, the development of which is covered in Section~\ref{sec:development_of_the_ICARUS_spectrum_code}, and \textsc{ICCS3D} \cite{krafft2016laser,ranjan2018simulation}. Both spectrum codes are described in detail in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}. The \textsc{ICARUS} spectrum is produced using Gaussian models for the electron bunch and laser pulse whereas \textsc{ICCS3D} uses a Gaussian electron bunch distribution that has been tracked using \textsc{Tao} through CBETA ICS bypass, as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:bypass_design}, to the interaction point. Both codes operate for a head-on ($\phi=0$) interaction, take into account the recoil effect, account for emittance in both transverse planes, model the effect of energy spread of the electron bunch and laser pulse (spectral bandwidth) and are capable of simulating both square and circular collimation. The CBETA ICS \textsc{ICARUS} and \textsc{ICCS3D} spectra show strong agreement as observed during the benchmarking of the three test cases in Section~\ref{sec:benchmarking_of_the_ICARUS_spectrum_code}.

This spectrum has a peak energy of 403.3~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}; using the proposed 5\si{\degree} crossing angle, the peak energy is reduced to 402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} and the spectral density is reduced by a factor $\sim$~5.56.}
\label{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking} the case of the CBETA ICS at 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} is shown with a peak photon energy of 403.3~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, 0.8~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} above the value shown in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output} because the spectrum is for the head-on case. The maximum photon energy is higher than the predicted Compton edge energy of a head-on interaction where $E_{\gamma}\approx405$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, because of the energy spread of the electron bunch and the spectral bandwidth of the laser pulse, which mean that an incident electron or photon can have a higher energy photon that the nominal energy ($E_{e} = 150$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}, $E_{L} = 1.17$~\si{\electronvolt}) and therefore photons are generated beyond the expected peak energy of the Compton edge. This phenomena also explains why the spectrum isn't hard edged but is smoothed around the peak scattered photon energy of the spectrum. 

The spectral density of the spectrum is truncated due to the collimator. However, the various optimisation procedures detailed in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra} are designed to mitigate this effect. The collimation is also crucial in providing the specified \textit{rms} bandwidth due to the scattered photon energy--scattering angle correspondence ($E_{\gamma}\propto\theta$) . The effect of emittance in the spectrum is directly observable in the long tails of the spectrum, the transverse emittance of the electron bunch varies the divergence of the scattered radiation and therefore allows lower energy photons to pass through the collimator. 

A collimated flux of $1.99\times 10^{9}$~ph/\si{\second} is calculated via the \textsc{ICARUS} spectrum in a head-on interaction for the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth using RB optimisation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking}. Upon inspection of Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}, the collimated flux of the \textsc{ICARUS} simulation is in very good agreement with the analytical collimated flux formula (Eq.~\ref{eq:collimated_flux}), where the collimated flux in a RB optimised 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth is $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{col}} = 3.57\times 10^{8}$~ph/\si{\second}, once the \textsc{ICARUS} value is adjusted by the angular crossing luminosity reduction factor (Eq.~\ref{eq:angular_crossing_factor})
\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{col}}^{\mathrm{ICARUS}}}{R_{AC}} &= \frac{1.99\times 10^{9}}{5.56} = 3.58\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{ph/\si{\second}}, \\
\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{col}}^{\mathrm{analytical}} &= 3.57\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{ph/\si{\second}}.
\label{eq:CBETA_ICARUS_yield}    
\end{align*}
Small variation is expected between the two values as the ICARUS code accounts for energy spread of the electron bunch and spectral bandwidth of the laser pulse.

\section{X-ray ICS Source Comparison}
\label{sec:xray_ICS_comparison}

Many inverse Compton scattering sources, driven by a variety of accelerator types, have been designed and built to operate in the x-ray regime, the CBETA ICS can be compared against these to evaluate the efficacy of the ERL driven ICS approach. Direct comparison is difficult as different designs have different objectives -- one design may prioritize maximizing flux while another prioritizes having a narrower bandwidth. Sources may also take different approaches to the interaction laser such as ICS sources that take advantage of high repetition rates via re-circulating a more modest energy laser pulse, with a focus on high average brilliance, and those that use high laser pulse energies, short pulses and low repetition rates, with a focus on high peak brilliance.  

To collate ICS sources of interest, we arbitrarily limit our discussions to the scattered photon energy range $1$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} ($\sim$10~\si{\angstrom}) $< E_{\gamma} <$ 1~\si{\mega\electronvolt} ($\sim$0.01~\si{\angstrom}) and very low flux ($\mathcal{F} < 10^{3}$~ph/\si{s}) ICS sources are neglected. A brief survey of x-ray inverse Compton sources is presented in Table~\ref{tab:xray_ICS_comparison}.

\label{tab:xray_ICS_comparison}
\end{table}

As evident from Table~\ref{tab:xray_ICS_comparison}, the 3rd and 4th pass ICS sources on CBETA nominally produce x-rays at 233~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} and 403~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} respectively, therefore the CBETA ICS source offers unparalleled access to the $< 200$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} x-ray regime, enabling a series of new high energy x-ray applications as shown in Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_ICS_applications}. Few other ICS sources operate within the 200~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}--1~\si{\mega\electronvolt} scattered photon energy range.

The highest flux x-ray ICS demonstration is the 1.78$\times 10^{10}$~ph/\si{\second} demonstration at MuCLS \cite{eggl2016munich}, which uses a small ($\sim4$~\si{\meter} diameter) storage ring and a 70~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power Fabry-Perot optical cavity. The CBETA ICS source design excels the MuCLS flux by a factor $\sim2$. However, CBETA ICS is also capable of a much smaller bandwidth due to the smaller energy spread and emittance of the ERL in comparison with the MuCLS storage ring. The CBETA ICS design outclasses the cERL ICS demonstration, the highest flux ERL driven ICS source, in terms of flux by a factor of $\sim1000$. As the Fabry-Perot optical cavity for CBETA is based upon the cERL ICS design, the difference is mainly due to the increase in bunch charge of CBETA in comparison to cERL (32~\si{\pico\coulomb} $>$ 0.355~\si{\pico\coulomb}) and the smaller electron bunch spot size at the interaction point (for the baseline case). Therefore, with a high brightness electron beam the ERL approach is competitive with the storage ring approach and offers advantages in narrow bandwidth operation. 

The design of the BriXS and ThomX ICS sources could achieve fluxes up to $10^{13}$~ph/\si{\second}, which are a factor $\sim300$ higher than those predicted for the CBETA ICS. In the BriXS case this is because the push-pull ERL design expects a much higher bunch charge than CBETA (32~\si{\pico\coulomb} < 200~\si{\pico\coulomb}) \cite{drebot2019brixs} and the average stored laser power at 750~\si{\kilo\watt} \cite{drebot2019brixs} is greater than the 670~\si{\kilo\watt} highest average stored power demonstration \cite{carstens2014megawatt} outside of an accelerator environment. Therefore, the increase in flux of the BriXS design is subject to optical cavity technical developments whereas the CBETA ICS source is conservative in laser parameters. The ThomX source intends to increase its flux in three steps corresponding to bunch charges of 50~\si{\pico\coulomb}, 100~\si{\pico\coulomb} and 1~\si{\nano\coulomb} with average stored powers in the Fabry-Perot cavity of 100~\si{\kilo\watt}, 500~\si{\kilo\watt} and 1~\si{\mega\watt} with the repetition rate being increased a factor of 5 from the first to second stage \cite{dupraz2020thomx}. These parameter sets lead to predicted fluxes of $10^{10}$~ph/\si{\second}, $10^{11}$~ph/\si{\second} and $10^{13}$~ph/\si{\second}. However, a Fabry-Perot optical cavity beyond the 70~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power demonstration of MuCLS \cite{eggl2016munich} has not been shown to be operable as part of an ICS source. When the ThomX source parameters are within the state-of-the-art, the flux is comparable to that of the CBETA ICS.

\section{Synchrotron Facility Comparison}
\label{sec:synchrotron_facility_comparison}

Inverse Compton production of photons at CBETA has the ability to extend the reach of monochromatic photon sources toward \si{\mega\electronvolt} scale, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}, operating in the high energy x-ray regime. Alternative sources of x-rays are bremsstrahlung methods, though these generate intrinsically broad-band radiation, line sources such as $^{137}$Cs and $^{60}$Co, and synchrotron radiation. Whilst line sources provide photons in the \si{\mega\electronvolt} scale, they are not tuneable, emit isotropically and require proper handling. Therefore, synchrotron radiation sources such as undulators are currently the premier method to generate intense, narrow-band radiation tunable on a \si{\kilo\electronvolt} to \si{\mega\electronvolt} scale. Hence, evaluation of the CBETA ICS as a source of monochromatic x-ray radiation is best attained by direct comparison with leading synchrotron radiation sources as well as other inverse Compton scattering sources (Section~\ref{sec:xray_ICS_comparison}). A discussion on bremsstrahlung and line source radiation generation is consequently suspended until discussion of $\gamma$-ray ICS source in the DIANA $\gamma$-ray ICS source design in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}, where the $\gamma$-ray photons ($E_{\gamma} > 1$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) can not be readily generated by synchrotron radiation.   

Krafft and Priebe \cite{krafft2010compton} hypothesised that flux and brilliance offered by ICS sources is not competitive at the photon energies produced by 3rd generation light sources such as synchrotron radiation facilities. Subsequently, recent x-ray ICS source designs are intended to compromise between typical laboratory-scale sources, such as rotating cathode tubes, and synchrotron radiation facilities in terms of size, cost, access, availability, and x-ray quality \cite{deitrick2018high}. The CBETA ICS source design provides scope to test Krafft and Priebe's hypothesis because it spans to the 100's~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} regime with comparable flux to other ICS sources, as shown in Section~\ref{sec:xray_ICS_comparison}, which allows better assessment of the utility of ICS production at the limits of synchrotron production.

Firstly, the limitations of the synchrotron radiation approach must be characterised. The characteristic critical photon energy for synchrotron radiation is
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{c}=\frac{3}{2}\frac{\hbar c \gamma^3}{\rho},
\label{eq:synchrotron_critical_energy}
\end{equation}
which can be recast in more natural units as $\epsilon_{c}$[\si{\kilo\electronvolt}]$\simeq 0.665E^{2}B$ (for $E$, the electron kinetic energy, given in \si{\giga\electronvolt} and $B$, the magnetic flux density of the bending magnets, in \si{\tesla}). The highest-energy 3rd-generation light source source today is SPring-8 with $E = 8$~\si{\giga\electronvolt} and $B\simeq 0.68$~\si{\tesla} to obtain a critical energy $\epsilon_{c}\simeq 29$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} for broadband incoherent SR production. Storage rings for 3rd generation light sources, such as SPring-8, have a physical circumference exceeding 1~\si{\kilo\meter} therefore due to financial considerations it is unlikely that a storage ring above 8~\si{\giga\electronvolt} will be built. Therefore, $\sim30$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} is a realistic limitation on the maximum photon energy produced by the fundamental harmonic of a 3rd generation light source.

The undulator minimum wavelength limit from a storage ring can be more strictly illustrated by setting the undulator $K$-parameter to be $K\sim 1$ and an undulator period $\lambda_u\sim$~1~\si{\centi\meter}. This gives a magnetic field limit of
\begin{equation}
B_0 = \frac{m_{e} c}{e}\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{u}} K \simeq 1\textrm{T}.
\label{eq:undulator_field_limit}
\end{equation}
The minimum undulator wavelength ($K=0$) possible (in the fundamental harmonic of emission) is
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\textrm{min} = \frac{\lambda_{u}}{2 \gamma^2} \simeq 0.2 \textrm{\AA}
\label{eq:undulator_minimum_wavelength}
\end{equation}
at 8~\si{\giga\electronvolt} ($\gamma \sim 15,700$), corresponding to a photon energy of $62$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. In practice, most hard x-ray undulators and wigglers operate up to around 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} photon energy by using higher harmonics, with few existing beamlines extending beyond that. Undulator output at higher harmonics is photon energy limited predominantly by the presence of magnetic phase errors, and the reduction factor $R$ in ideal flux from an \textit{rms} phase error $\sigma_{\phi}$ can be modelled approximately \cite{walker1993interference} using 
\begin{equation}
R=\exp{\left(-n^2 \sigma_{\phi}^{2}\right)},
\label{eq:undulator_phase_errors}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is an integer (odd) undulator harmonic number, and $\sigma_\phi$ typically has a value of a few degrees \cite{walker2013phase}. In practice magnetic phase errors limit undulators in operation to the $n<15$ harmonics, although there is still debate on the pessimism of the \textit{rms} error in some cases \cite{tanaka2018universal} and around schemes for reduction of $\sigma_{\phi}$ future insertion devices \cite{hwang2011development,huang2017challenges}.

Hard x-ray sources presently available at the high-energy storage rings APS \cite{apsbeamlines}, ESRF-EBS \cite{esrfbeamlines}, PETRA-III \cite{petraiiibeamlines}, and SPring-8 \cite{spring8beamlines}, have been surveyed. The codes \textsc{SPECTRA} \cite{tanaka2001spectra} and \textsc{SRW} \cite{chubar2013wavefront} are used to validate expected spectral output \cite{tanaka2001field} of these synchrotron sources. For example, the flux of the SPring-8 BL10XU beamline subject to a 5\si{\degree} \textit{rms} phase error is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}; this is compared with sample fluxes at the source points presented by SPring-8 \cite{spring8beamlines} and with the predicted uncollimated flux in a 0.1\% \textit{FWHM} bandwidth (Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_0.1_bandwidth}) from the CBETA ICS source design.

The undulator shown is the SPring-8 BL10XU insertion device \cite{spring8beamlines} assuming an \textit{rms} phase error of 5\si{\degree}. Whilst this undulator is not designed to deliver good output at high harmonic number, it offers a useful guide to possible 3rd-generation source output in the 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} to 500~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} range. The measured flux at 30~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} and 61~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} for this beamline is also shown \cite{spring8beamlines}. We predict that CBETA flux at 402~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} (150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron energy) exceeds that from 3rd-generation sources.}
\label{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}
\end{figure}

The predicted average brilliance of the CBETA ICS source at the nominal energies of each turn is compared in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Brilliance} with a high-energy undulator (BL10XU) at SPring-8 -- the worlds highest-energy 3rd-generation synchrotron source. Because the SPring-8 BL10XU undulator is not particularly atypical, Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Brilliance} is indicative of achievable brilliance from other state-of-the-art synchrotron facilities. This statement also holds for the case of the spectral flux (Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_0.1_bandwidth}) in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design/spring8bl10brillianceplot.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of CBETA predicted average brilliance at the four discrete operating energies given in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output} with the output from a typical high-energy undulator.

\label{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Brilliance}
\end{figure}

As hypothesized by Krafft and Priebe \cite{krafft2010compton}, storage ring sources produce greater brilliance and flux at high harmonic number for photon energies up to approximately 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. However, the fundamental energy scaling of synchrotron radiation and the finite undulator magnetic field quality means that the ICS output from CBETA becomes superior beyond 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. From Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}, the measured flux at 30~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} and 61~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} \cite{spring8beamlines} is orders of magnitude superior to that from an ICS source, but at 400~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} this is reversed. From inspection of other ICS source designs in Table~\ref{tab:xray_ICS_comparison}, it is evident that ICS sources are projected to achieve $\sim 10^{10} - 10^{13}$~ph/\si{\second} quasi-independently of scattered photon energy so the conclusion can be broadened to state that the interface between utility of ICS sources and 3rd generation light sources lies at $< 300$~\si{kilo\electronvolt}. Therefore, the hypothesis of Krafft and Priebe \cite{krafft2010compton} must be modified to note that ICS sources become competitive against synchrotron light sources at around 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}.

This is compared with the predicted CBETA outputs using (Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_0.1_bandwidth}), at the 4 discrete photon energies from 32 to 402~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, and the predicted flux obtained by scaling the CBETA electron energy to 300~\si{\mega\electronvolt} (1.60~\si{\mega\electronvolt} photons) and 600~\si{\mega\electronvolt} (6.36~\si{\mega\electronvolt} photons). Whilst 3rd generation sources are superior to ICS sources up to photon energies around 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, no synchrotron light source produces useable flux above 400~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}.}
\label{fig:ICS_Undulator_Comparison}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_Undulator_Comparison} compares the on-sample measured fluxes from those high-energy synchrotron beamlines ($>$30~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) for which data is available \cite{apsbeamlines,esrfbeamlines,petraiiibeamlines,spring8beamlines}. Few synchrotron beamlines generate radiation above 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, and above 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} we have shown that ICS is a superior production method. Extending the demonstrated CBETA parameters to higher electron energy we would expect the collimated flux values to remain nearly constant as we see that flux in inverse Compton scattering sources is broadly independent of electron kinetic energy. Hence we can estimate the likely possible flux for \si{\mega\electronvolt}-scale photons from a CBETA style ERL-based source. Therefore, two indicative electron energies (300~\si{\mega\electronvolt} and 600~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) are included in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_Undulator_Comparison}. The fluxes at 100's~\si{\mega\electronvolt}, based on a conservatively designed multi-pass ERL ICS, highlight the potential of this approach to $\gamma$-ray sources. 

\section{CBETA ICS Applications}
\label{sec:CBETA_ICS_applications}

The proposed CBETA ICS design provides a high-flux, tuneable, quasi-monochromatic source of x-rays, producing high peak energy photons in the 100's~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} range. Large flux ($\sim 10^{10}$ph/\si{\second}) at high energies ($< 100$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) opens up a parameter space for x-ray applications previously attainable only at the largest synchrotrons, using substantial x-ray optics. Section~\ref{sec:synchrotron_facility_comparison} has shown that the CBETA ICS can achieve fluxes of $3.16\times 10^{10}$~ph/\si{\second} up to 402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, beyond that possible at a synchrotron radiation facilities therefore enabling new applications. Within this section an overview of the potential applications of the CBETA ICS are presented.   

Scattered photon beams produced by the CBETA ICS source could be used in important applications such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) \cite{willmott2019introduction}. High-energy XRF is a well-suited application for ICS sources, as monochromation is not required, thereby avoiding complex x-ray optical instrumentation. Energy-sensitive x-ray fluorescence detection can be provided by a solid-state detector coupled to a pulse-height analyzer. For example, in analysis of a fission reactor's fuel rods, the $K\alpha$ and $K\beta$ lines for uranium ($K\alpha_{1} = 98.4$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, $K\beta_{1} = 111.3$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) and plutonium ($K\alpha_{1} = 103.7$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, $K\beta_{1} = 117.2$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) could be probed \cite{havrilla2015feasibility}. Quantitative assays and elemental determination would be performed through use of a low-$Z$ reference scatterer to ascertain the spectral content of the broadband incident beam via the elastic and Compton scattering into the same detector. Known energy dependent photo-absorption cross sections of sample then enable determination of the fluorescence efficiency of the detection scheme for elements of interest.

High energy photon production from the CBETA ICS source allows imaging of thick specimens as penetration depth of x-ray radiation scales with photon energy. The CBETA ICS source could therefore be a prime tool to apply straightforward techniques such as 2D shadowgraphy  to more complex 3D reconstruction with tomography \cite{als2011elements} to thick samples. For example, inverse Compton scattering x-rays have been applied to lithium battery material studies \cite{suzuki2015extracting,suzuki2016non,suzuki2019high}, where a higher energy is advantageous over other spectroscopies as it
allows a bulk-sensitive measurement of a disordered system
under sample conditions of temperature, magnetic field,
and pressure and also enables measurement of a sample inside a metal
container, which can be penetrated by high-energy x-rays \cite{suzuki2015extracting}. Therefore, the higher photon energies enabled by the CBETA ICS, could extend the range of experiments conducted at existing synchrotron radiation facilities.

Energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDXRD), used for the identification of constituents of a poly-crystalline or powdered sample, is another application which exploits the high flux and high energy of the source. A high-flux source would allow for rapid identification of the minerals in a mined ore sample, while again the high energy of the source allows for the inspection of thick specimens. For commercial applications such as these, the compact nature of the CBETA ICS is also advantageous. In EDXRD \cite{kampfe2005energy} one applies the non-monochromated peak to a specimen of the material of interest, and checks for diffracted photons with an energy-sensitive solid-state detector. From the diffracted photon energy the wavelength can be deduced, and via application of the Bragg relation a combination of Miller indices and lattice spacing of the reflecting crystalline planes is returned. Survey of many crystalline plane reflections in a particular mineral provides constituent identification; the intensity of these Bragg peaks provides the relative abundances of the various mineral components. 

Furthermore, we consider applications that would required significant beamline infrastructure in contrast to previously discussed applications. Non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NIXS) \cite{isaacs1996inelastic} could be performed to examine the dynamic electronic response of materials. The inherent high scattered photon energy and large flux of the CBETA ICS sources allows experimentation of novel materials such as transition metal oxides, which provide insight into high-temperature superconductor candidates \cite{hasan2002momentum,isaacs1996inelastic}. Experimental test of the Mott-Hubbard model \cite{hubbard1963electron,mott1949basis} could also be accomplished via the application of high photon energy NIXS to transition metal oxides \cite{isaacs1996resonant}.

The energy resolution requirements for NIXS are severe -- 1~\si{\electronvolt} out of 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} i.e $10^{-5}$ \textit{FWHM} bandwidth -- though the minimum theoretical \textit{FWHM} bandwidth of the CBETA ICS is $2.8\times 10^{-3}$. Therefore a high-energy x-ray monochromator and analyzer optics must be developed to facilitate this application. A possible route to the stringent monochromator conditions is via a synthetic multi-layer construction, used to provide an optimal match to beam optics. For an implementation of the NIXS technique at the CBETA ICS the analyzers would be arrayed at a range of scattering angles for measurement of a comprehensive set of momentum transfers. The pass energy of the analyzers is fixed while the incident energy is scanned to provide variable energy transfers with a double crystal monochromator configuration \cite{schulke2007electron,fister2006multielement}. Because of sample self absorption and the weak signal set by the small Thomson cross section \cite{schulke2007electron}, further reduced by monochromation requirements, the applicability of NIXS is limited for medium to large Z elements. Performance of NIXS at an incident energy of 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} as proposed here would provide an attenuation length due to photo-absorption of 100~\si{\micro\meter}. This is a factor of 25 greater \cite{TungstenGraph} than that provided at the contemporary hard NIXS facility at the Advanced Photon Source \cite{fister2006multielement}, which operates with an incident energy of 10~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} when performing spectroscopy with the low energy transfers widely used in condensed matter studies.  

Another potential application of the CBETA ICS, requiring substantial end station development is parametric down conversion (PDC). Entangled photon pairs could be generated via parametric down conversion from the scattered photons incident upon a mixing crystal. Here the efficiency is increased by operating at high scattered photon energy, since the intensity of the vacuum fluctuations present at the incidence of the mixing crystal is proportional to the fourth power of the scattered photon energy ($I \propto E_{\gamma}^{4}$) \cite{eisenberger1971x}.
Alongside the achievement of PDC at approximately a factor of five higher energy than is currently practised \cite{schori2018ghost}, this experiment could provide exciting applications such as twin microscopy -- which promises enhanced visibility through quantum ghost imaging of otherwise inaccessible specimens -- and twin ellipsometry for the careful examination of surface structures \cite{simon2017quantum}. The ghost imaging demonstration of Schori et al \cite{schori2018ghost} was recently performed at the BL19LXU SPring-8 beamline \cite{yabashi2001design} with an input energy of 22.3~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}; using the CBETA ICS source at 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} would provide PDC generation according to the aforementioned scaling law with a zero point energy flux advantage of about 400 times greater.  

\section{Summary}

In summary, the retrofittable CBETA ICS source design study has shown that the ERL driven ICS approach is capable of delivering a high flux ($\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{col}} =$ 3.68--3.57$\times 10^{8}$~ph/\si{\second}) of high energy x-rays ($E_{\gamma} =$ 32.2--402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) within a narrow bandwidth ($\left(\Delta E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}\right)_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.5$\%). A bypass line to the CBETA multi-turn ERL has been designed for production of photons from 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunches in CBETA, with tunable focusing which could be extended to each nominal energy of the CBETA ERL. In comparison with other designed and demonstrated ICS sources, as shown by Table~\ref{tab:xray_ICS_comparison}, the CBETA ICS is comparable in flux and extends the scattered photon energy range of conventional x-ray ICS sources. The multi-turn ERL design of CBETA has been shown to be an effective route to a multi-coulour ICS source. 

A prototype design of a bypass beamline to the existing CBETA ERL has been shown, which allows for RB optimised operation of the ICS source at the maximum 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} kinetic energy. The bypass design satisfies conditions imposed by a multi-turn ERL such as path length and $R_{56}$ adjustment, whilst providing tunable focusing at the IP and adhering reasonable magnet specifications. Discussion is included on extension of this bypass design to a multi-colour x-ray ICS source.  

At the specified design parameters, the CBETA narrowband high energy x-ray ICS source could facilitate a wide variety of experiments typically only available at a synchrotron light source, whilst allowing for experiments requiring high energy photons such as thick specimen experimentation in fields such as lithium battery development and nuclear waste management. Comparative studies with synchrotron sources in Section~\ref{sec:synchrotron_facility_comparison} have demonstrated that above $\sim300$ synchrotron light source facilities are incapable of producing the x-ray flux available at ICS sources within this energy range. Therefore, ICS sources can be postulated as the premier technology for narrowband $\gamma$-ray production, which motivated further investigation of \si{\mega\electronvolt}-scale ICS sources with the DIANA ERL ICS design study in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}.
