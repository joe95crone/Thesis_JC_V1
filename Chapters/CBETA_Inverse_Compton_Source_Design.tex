\section{Motivation for a CBETA Inverse Compton Scattering Source}

The CBETA ERL is the first demonstration of an SRF multi-pass ERL \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}, which enables a compact accelerator to provide 100's~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron beams with small emittance ($\epsilon_{n} < 1$~\si{\milli\meter}-\si{\milli\radian}) and small relative energy spread whilst aiming to deliver a high electron beam power ($P_{\mathrm{avg}} = 6$~\si{\mega\watt}) -- though not yet achieved. These factors contribute to a high-quality, high-brillance electron beam which is an ideal driver of an inverse Compton source. Another advantage of using a multi-pass ERL to drive an ICS source is that ICS sources can be constructed to use each of the four nominal electron bunch energies of the CBETA accelerator; therefore a multi-colour radiation source is possible. Consequently, an x-ray light source can be designed to harness CBETA and provide high-quality, high-energy x-ray beams within a compact footprint. A high-energy x-ray source is desired to increase the x-ray photon energy currently available at Cornell university via the CHESS synchrotron light source, which produces a monochromatic x-ray beam up to 80~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} \cite{CHESSstructuralmaterialsbeamline}. 

The maximum electron beam energy of the CBETA at 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt}, interacted with an Nd:YAG laser ($\lambda=1064$~\si{\nano\meter}), enables production of x-rays with a minimum wavelength of $\lambda = 0.03$~\si{\angstrom} ($E_{\gamma} = 402$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}), extending the reach of current synchrotron facilities, such as the CHESS synchrotron \cite{CHESSstructuralmaterialsbeamline}, which are limited to the $E_{\gamma} \approx 300$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} range, as demonstrated later in Section~\ref{sec:synchrotron_facility_comparison}. A smaller wavelength enables new applications such as tomography of thick specimens and non-resonant inelastic scattering (NIXS) of transition metal oxides -- of relevance to development of high temperature superconductors \cite{isaacs1996resonant}.
 
Inherent in the inverse Compton scattering process is a correspondence between photon energy and scattering angle ($E_{\gamma} = f\left(\theta\right)$), therefore simple collimation is adequate to select a bandwidth of photons from an ICS source -- assuming a well collimated monochromatic electron beam. Simple collimation can remain viable once geometric bunch--pulse effects are accounted for. This is in contrast to synchrotron and bremmsstrahlung sources, where complicated optical arrangements -- like monochromators -- are required to select a user specified photon bandwidth. Therefore, compact ICS sources may have an additional advantage of less complex experimental optics for users in comparison to similar x-ray production methods; an advantage that becomes apparent at higher photon energies where crystal monochromators become difficult and less efficient \cite{lienert1998focusing}. 
 
Production of narrow-bandwidth radiation is plausible using an ERL ICS source, evidenced by inspection of (Eq.~\ref{eq:RMS_bandwidth}), as ERLs such as CBETA have small energy spread and are capable of very small emittances ($\epsilon_{n} = 0.3$~\si{\milli\meter}-\si{\milli\radian}). Consequently, design of a CBETA inverse Compton scattering source would be informative toward narrow-band radiation sources in the $\gamma$-ray regime ($E_{\gamma} > 1$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}). On the \si{\mega\electronvolt}-scale only the bremsstrahlung process is competitive with ICS as a high-flux source, but bremsstrahlung suffers from an inherent broad bandwidth and, due to the high scattered photon energies, monochromation is much less feasible.

In summary, ERLs combine the best of both types of accelerators: delivering higher-quality beams than storage rings, with greater energy efficiency than a linac \cite{smith2006optic}. As the beam parameters necessary for scientific research call for higher current and higher quality beams, ERLs are the accelerators best-suited to meet this demand. Multi-turn ERLs, which accelerate the electron beam multiple times before decelerating the beam, capitalise upon the ability to reach higher energies without additional cost, power requirements, or floor space \cite{merminga2003high}. Inverse Compton scattering sources benefit from both the high current, energy and quality electron beams delivered by ERLs which translates into high flux, narrow bandwidth ICS sources desired by users. 

\section{ERL Electron Beam and Optical Cavity Laser Pulse Parameters}
\label{sec:CBETA_electron_laser_parameters}

\subsection{The CBETA Inverse Compton Scattering Source}
\label{sec:CBETA_ICS_source_description}

The CBETA ICS source would generate x-ray radiation through the interaction of the electron bunches of the CBETA ERL transported through an interaction bypass line, as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:bypass_design}, with a counter-propagating Nd:YAG laser pulse ($\lambda=1064$~\si{\nano\meter}) that is re-circulated in a Fabry--Perot optical cavity (see Section~\ref{sec:lasers_fabry_perot}). Both electron bunch and laser pulse are focused to a small transverse spot size at the interaction point in the optical cavity. A proposed schematic of the electron bunch--laser pulse interaction region of the CBETA ICS source is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Interaction}. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design/CBETA_ICS_Interaction_fixed.pdf}
\caption{Interaction of the electron bunch (blue) with a Nd:YAG laser pulse (red) at the interaction point (green) within a 4-mirror Fabry-Perot re-circulating optical cavity (grey). The interaction occurs at the center of the electron bunch final focus system of the CBETA ICS bypass, see Section~\ref{sec:bypass_design}, at a crossing angle $\phi=5$\si{\degree} to avoid electrons impinging upon and damaging the Fabry-Perot mirrors \cite{variola2011luminosity}.}
\label{fig:CBETA_ICS_Interaction}
\end{figure}

The optical re-circulation cavity is designed to operate at an identical pulse repetition frequency to the CBETA ERL bunch repetition rate, so each bunch is interacted with a laser pulse, generating x-ray radiation which propagates in the direction of the electron bunch. The parameters of the electron bunch and laser pulse within the CBETA ICS source design are given in Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_electron_laser_parameters}. To avoid electron bunches colliding with and damaging the optical mirrors \cite{variola2011luminosity} a 5\si{\degree} crossing angle is introduced, between the laser pulse and electron bunch. Utilising a Fabry-Perot cavity allows a higher rate of interactions at the cost of a reduced laser pulse energy in comparison to a single-shot laser setup, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:lasers_fabry_perot}, however this takes advantage of a the re-circulated electron bunch to provide a higher flux.

\subsection{Electron Beam Parameters}
\label{sec:CBETA_ICS_electron_parameters}

Electron bunch parameters for the CBETA inverse Compton scattering source are conducive to a high brightness electron beam with a low energy spread, which is necessary to meet design goals of a high flux, high average brilliance x-ray source with narrow-bandwidth capabilities. For a large flux, a smaller electron beam spot size at the IP is needed; while a larger spot can be beneficial for a narrower scattered photon bandwidth, photon bandwidth ultimately depends on the electron beam divergence and energy spread. The electron parameters for the design of the CBETA inverse Compton scattering source are mainly based on the design parameters of the CBETA ERL as presented in its design report \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta}. However, these were modified here, to optimise inverse Compton scattering production and retrospectively of the multi-pass commissioning \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}, which demonstrated several challenges in attaining the 40~\si{\milli\ampere} design current discussed in Chapter~\ref{CBETA_Multi-Pass_Commissioning}. 

The electron bunch parameters have been optimised, as detailed in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}, for narrowband operation ($\left(\Delta E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}\right)_{\mathrm{rms}} < 1\%$) of the ICS source using the round beam optimisation in Section~\ref{sec:RB_optimisation}. The round beam optimisation can be readily applied to the CBETA ICS design as the emittance is identical in each plane ($\epsilon_{n,x}=\epsilon_{n,y}=\epsilon_{b}$) and the emittance is small ($\epsilon_{n}=0.3$~\si{\milli\meter}--\si{\milli\radian}) such that the spot size at the IP will be approximately round for small $\beta$-functions at the IP. Single point bandwidth RB optimisations for a 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth are presented alongside a tuning curve in the 0--1\% \textit{rms} bandwidth range defined as narrowband. The results of these optimisations, using a round electron bunch, are described later in this section. The narrowband optimised case is used to calculate the collimated flux of the source at a 0.5\% bandwidth in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}.

A baseline case is proposed to characterise the spectrum of the ICS source without collimation, where the design aim is solely to produce a high flux of x-rays. A high flux of x-rays is achieved with a small spot size, therefore in the baseline case the $\beta$-function at the interaction point $\beta^{*}$, remains constant and small ($\beta^{*}=0.01$~\si{\meter}) across all nominal electron bunch energies produced by the CBETA ERL. The baseline case is used to characterise the performance of the CBETA ICS source through several spectral output parameters: uncollimated flux (Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_angular_crossing_hourglass}), spectral density (Eq.~\ref{eq:spectral_density}), average brilliance (Eq.~\ref{eq:average_brilliance}) and peak brilliance (Eq.~\ref{eq:peak_brilliance}) as given in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}. These parameters can only be calculated satisfactorily for an uncollimated spectrum, therefore we limit our calculations of these parameters to the baseline case.  Therefore, the baseline case also enables comparison against other similar ICS projects in Section~\ref{sec:xray_ICS_comparison}, which may not be designed to produce narrow bandwidth. 

\begin{table}[!h]
\caption{Electron beam parameters envisaged at the CBETA ICS source interaction point (IP). Both baseline and optimised parameters assume a round transverse profile for the electron bunch. The given baseline parameters -- which assume a constant $\beta^*$-function -- allow a comparison of flux and brilliance (peak and average) at different electron bunch energies and characterise the uncollimated ICS spectrum. The round beam optimised values beneath those correspond to maximal flux into a 0.5\% \textit{rms} scattered photon bandwidth.}

The design of the CBETA ERL \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta} allows for a maximum bunch charge of 123~\si{\pico\coulomb} -- required for the target 40~\si{\milli\ampere} average beam current, with a 325~\si{\mega\hertz} repetition rate -- whilst the bunch charge assumed in this design is 32~\si{\pico\coulomb}, a factor $\sim$~4 lower. Reduction in bunch charge is needed because the coherent synchrotron radiation production through the FFA return loop (see Chapter~\ref{CBETA_Multi-Pass_Commissioning}) at 123~\si{\pico\coulomb} increases both beam emittance and energy spread to intolerable levels -- after 4-turn energy recovery with a 123~\si{\pico\coulomb} bunch the energy spread exceeds the $\pm 7$\% energy acceptance of the beam dump \cite{lou2020coherent} -- therefore, a limit on the bunch charge of 32~\si{\pico\coulomb} has been imposed. 

A 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz} repetition frequency is proposed, identical to the pulse repetition frequency of the optical cavity, required so that each electron bunch interacts with a laser pulse. The limit of 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz} is due to the Fabry-Perot optical cavity misalignment and average stored power limitations, as explained in Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_laser_parameters}. The 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz} repetition rate is half of the 325~\si{\mega\hertz} repetition rate specified in the CBETA design \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta}, which means the average beam current is halved from the design values irrespective of the bunch charge limitations. The  40~\si{\milli\ampere} maximum average beam current of the CBETA ERL design is reduced to 5.2~\si{\milli\ampere} average beam current for operation of the CBETA ICS source. The 5.2~\si{\milli\ampere} average beam current is well within the theoretical current limitations of the beam break-up instability (BBU) studied by Lou and Hoffstaetter for the CBETA ERL \cite{lou2019beam}, where average beam currents beyond 40~\si{\milli\ampere} were tolerable in simulation.   

The electron bunch duration of the CBETA ICS at the IP is 3.33~\si{\pico\second}, comparable to other ERLs \cite{angal2018perle} and ERL ICS projects such as the cERL ICS \cite{akagi2016narrow}. Therefore, with similar laser pulse duration of 10~\si{\pico\second}, given in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}, the scattered radiation is produced with picosecond-scale duration. Because the laser pulse duration is larger than the electron bunch duration, limitation of the scattered photon pulse duration arises due to the limitations of the Nd:YAG laser system discussed in Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_laser_parameter}.

Single-turn commissioning of the CBETA ERL successfully demonstrated the operation of the FFA return beamline with electron beams in an energy range from 39 to 59~\si{\mega\electronvolt} \cite{gulliford2019beam,gulliford2021measurement}. Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the CBETA ERL could be operated over this range to generate ICS photons from the first turn configuration. This would allow production of scattered photons with continuously tuneable energy in the range 27.8 to 63.0~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. Extending the argument to the demonstrated 4-turn configuration \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}, Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_energy_tuning} indicates the possible scattered photon energies using either the nominal energies of the 4 passes, or from the tuneable electron kinetic energy of a single pass. Since tuning of the scattered photon energy of inverse Compton scattering sources is most practical by the variation of the electron beam kinetic energy, Fig~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_energy_tuning} is indicative of the likely scattered photon energy tuning range at the CBETA ICS which would be analogous to those possible at other proposed multi-pass ERL facilities.

\caption{An ICS source generating photons from each of the four CBETA ERL passes delivers the (fixed) scattered energies indicated here; we assume a fixed incident laser wavelength of 1064~\si{\nano\meter}. CBETA has also experimentally demonstrated tuning of single-pass acceleration from 39 to 59~\si{\mega\electronvolt} (indicated by the shaded region), which indicates the continuous tuning of scattered photon energy that an ERL in general might deliver.}

\end{figure}

The CBETA ICS has been optimised using the round beam optimisation method, as explained in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}. The optimisation involves a trade-off of the $\beta$-function at the IP $\beta^{*}$ and collimation angle $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ to maximise the flux in a 0.5\% \textit{rms} narrow bandwidth. Variables are quoted for a 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth of the scattered radiation because this is an adequate demonstration of a narrow-band ICS source ($\left(\Delta E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}\right)_{\mathrm{rms}} < 1$~\%). The $\beta$-function at the IP and collimation angle that correspond to the maximal collimated flux for a 0.5\% bandwidth are shown in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters}. In addition, the collimated flux of the source can be mapped throughout the narrowband range ($0 \geq \left(\Delta E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}\right)_{\mathrm{rms}} \geq 1$\%) by applying the methodology in Section~\ref{sec:RB_optimisation}, to produce a tuning curve of maximum collimated flux against \textit{rms} bandwidth and the corresponding  Pareto-optimal front in parameter space -- named the parameter space tuning curve. The round beam parameter space tuning curves at each nominal electron energy of CBETA are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space}, whilst the collimated flux--\textit{rms} bandwidth tuning curves are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve} of Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_spectral_output}, as these map the spectral output of the source.

\caption{Tuning curves of $\beta^{*}$ against $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ for each of the nominal CBETA electron beam energies satisfying the maximal flux across the 0--1\% \textit{rms} bandwidth range. The shaded area is the parameter space, while the line corresponds to the maximal flux solution for a given \textit{rms} bandwidth. Minimised bandwidth solutions in this range have large $\beta$-functions at the IP and small collimation angles $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$; the maximal bandwidth solutions have small $\beta$-functions and larger collimation angles $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$.}
\label{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space}
\end{figure}

Each of the tuning curves (for each nominal CBETA electron energy) of the $\beta^{*}-\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ parameter spaces in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space} has a distinctive `elbow' shape - a near-linear regime followed by a non-linear regime -- as previously seen for parameter space tuning curves in benchmarking of the round beam optimisation in Section~\ref{sec:RB_optimisation}. The Pareto-optimal parameter space front shows a linear relationship as the collimation angle increases; this part is dominated by the emittance term, until a vertex is reached and, as collimation angle increases, there is a non-linear shape where the Pareto front is dominated by the collimation term (Eq.~\ref{eq:collimation_term}). Wide bandwidth solutions have larger collimation angle and smaller $\beta$-functions at the IP whereas narrow bandwidths require small collimation angle and a large $\beta^{*}$-function. Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space} clearly shows an energy dependence of the optimal $\beta$-functions at the IP and the collimation angles; consequently the interaction region optics and collimation of a multi-colour ICS source must be varied for optimum performance across a range of bandwidths. 

\subsection{Laser Pulse and Fabry-Perot Optical Cavity}
\label{sec:CBETA_laser_parameters}

The CBETA ICS source is designed to use a Nd:YAG ($\lambda=1064$~\si{\nano\meter}) laser enhanced and re-circulated within a Fabry-Perot optical cavity, which are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:lasers_fabry_perot}. The laser pulse parameters within the optical cavity are based on the Fabry-Perot optical cavity demonstrated in the cERL inverse Compton scattering source \cite{akagi2016narrow}. An identical bow-tie 4-mirror cavity is envisioned for the CBETA ICS, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Interaction}, but a full design of a Fabry-Perot optical cavity was foreseen as beyond the scope of this source design. Focus here is on design of electron accelerators toward high flux, narrow bandwidth ICS sources, not on laser system design for ICS sources. The laser pulse and Fabry-Perot optical cavity parameters of the CBETA ICS source are specified in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}. 

\begin{table}[!h]

\end{table}

A Nd:YAG laser ($\lambda = 1064$~\si{\nano\meter}) is proposed for the CBETA ICS as Nd:YAG lasers typically have a a narrow spectral bandwidth in comparison to other possible interaction lasers ( such as Ti:Sa lasers); Nd:YAG lasers are also widely available. Longer wavelength lasers, such as a CO$_{2}$ laser \cite{pogorelsky2020converting} ($\lambda = 10.6$~\si{\micro\meter}), produce incident photons of lower energy and therefore for an invariant pulse energy there is a higher photon density in the interacted pulse, which in turn increases the output flux of the ICS source. However, the desire for higher energy x-rays makes a Nd:YAG laser with a 1064~\si{\nano\meter} wavelength preferable for this design. In addition, for a high repetition rate of inverse Compton scattering interactions it is necessary to have re-circulation of the laser pulse which requires high-finesse (high reflection coefficient) optical mirrors which have been developed more thoroughly in the infrared regime. 

The Fabry-Perot optical cavity repetition rate of the CBETA ICS is set at 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz} because this is the highest repetition rate that has been demonstrated within an ERL ICS source \cite{akagi2016narrow}. Optical cavities of higher repetition rate have been demonstrated, such as the 250~\si{\mega\hertz} cavity by Carstens et al \cite{carstens2014megawatt}, however these studies are typically conducted without nearby accelerators i.e. not as part of ICS sources. Stable operation of optical cavities with a nearby acceleractor can be impacted by compromised steering of
the laser beam by thermally induced
stress in optics, for example if those components are placed in close
proximity to strong conventional magnets \cite{gunther2019device}. A repetition rate of 325~\si{\mega\hertz} would be ideal as this would allow operation at the nominal CBETA ERL bunch repetition rate \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta}. However, in this domain the total path length of the cavity (for a single pulse configuration) must be 0.92~\si{\meter} for a 325~\si{\mega\hertz} cavity in comparison to 1.84~\si{\meter} at 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz}, which presents engineering challenges such as misalignment of the cavity mirrors and an inevitably larger crossing angle for a planar cavity. Multiple pulses could be utilised in a larger path length cavity to increase the repetition rate however, averaged stored cavity power limitations would negate this benefit. General issues with optical cavity design are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:lasers_fabry_perot}. Due to these limitations, a more conservative choice of a 162.5~\si{\mega\hertz} interaction repetition rate was selected. The repetition rate of the electron bunches must also match this ratio, hence why the CBETA ERL is limited to half of the original design bunch repetition rate as stated in Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_ICS_electron_parameters}. 

An Nd:YAG laser typically operates with a 10--20~\si{\pico\second} \textit{rms} pulse duration, which is ideal for the CBETA ICS source as this is well matched to the 3.33~\si{\pico\second} electron bunch duration. The laser pulse duration is fixed by the parameters of the Nd:YAG laser system, which is identical to that the cERL ICS laser system \cite{akagi}, unless a compression scheme is used such as the well-known chirped pulse amplification technique \cite{strickland1985compression}. Picosecond scale pulse duration is advantageous because it diminishes the effect of the hourglass (Eq.~\ref{eq:furman_hourglass_reduction}) and angular crossing (Eq.~\ref{eq:angular_crossing_factor}) effects \cite{miyahara2008luminosity} discussed in Section~\ref{sec:geometric_luminosity_reduction}, whilst also avoiding the timing complexity for the ICS interaction that would be associated with shorter durations. With invariant average laser power, shorter laser pulse durations would also increase the peak power of the laser upon the Fabry-Perot cavity mirrors increasing the possibility of surface hot-spot defects, which reduce average stored power in the optical cavity \cite{wang2020prior}. In addition, the 10~\si{\pico\second} laser pulse duration reflects the pulse duration used in the state-of-the-art 670~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power optical cavity demonstration with a 1040~\si{\nano\meter} wavelength laser \cite{carstens2014megawatt}.     

An \textit{rms} spot size at the IP of 25~\si{\micro\meter} is proposed as this has been experimentally demonstrated on the cERL ICS experiment \cite{akagi2016narrow}, limited by astigamatism in the mirrors and the large spot size of the laser pulse on the mirrors for a very small focus due to the Rayleigh range (Eq.~\ref{eq:laser_waist}). The CBETA ICS Fabry--Perot cavity is proposed to operate at a 5\si{\degree} crossing angle to the electron bunch, as in the cERL ICS experiment \cite{akagi2016narrow}, and similar to other ICS designs \cite{faillace2019status,variola2014thomx}. A 5\si{\degree} crossing angle is required because the electron bunch should not be incident on the cavity mirrors to avoid mirror damage and electron bunch distortion. With a narrow focus constraining the laser pulse spot size on the mirrors and a fixed path length (from the fixed repetition frequency), the minimum feasible crossing angle is on the order of 5\si{\degree}.   

The proposed spectral bandwidth (relative energy spread of the laser pulse) is not directly stated within the cERL paper \cite{akagi2016narrow}, however based on the pulse duration of the laser, the characteristic small spectral bandwidth of Nd:YAG lasers \cite{thorlabs2021ndyag450,thorlabs2021ndyag200} ($\Delta\lambda=$0.5--2~\si{\nano\meter}) and the energy selecting nature of a Fabry-Perot cavity an approximation of a $\Delta \lambda = 0.7$~\si{\nano\meter} \cite{corner2019personal} \textit{rms} wavelength variation is assumed, resulting in a $\Delta E_{L}/E_{L}=6.57\times 10^{-4}$ \textit{rms} spectral bandwidth. The spectral bandwidth of other lasers, such as the Thorlabs Octavius--85M--HP Ti:Sa laser ($\lambda = 800$~\si{\nano\meter}), with $\Delta\lambda=70.7$~\si{\nano\meter} and a \textit{rms} spectral bandwidth of $\Delta E_{L}/E_{L} = 0.0884$ \cite{thorlabs2021tisa}, and Yb:YAG laser ($\lambda=1030$~\si{\nano\meter}), with $\Delta\lambda=5$~\si{\nano\meter} and a \textit{rms} spectral bandwidth of $\Delta E_{L}/E_{L} = 4.85\times 10^{-3}$ \cite{thorlabs2021ybyag}.       
The Fabry--Perot cavity in the CBETA ICS source design has an average stored power of 10~\si{\kilo\watt}, which is much below the state-of-the-art 670~\si{\kilo\watt} stored power demonstration by Carstens et al \cite{carstens2014megawatt} and 383~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power demonstration by the ThomX collaboration \cite{liu2018optical}. However, these demonstrations operated the Fabry--Perot cavity separately of an accelerator as an accelerator can negatively affect stability of optical cavities (see Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_laser_parameters}). Operated as part of an ICS source, 70~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power at a repetition rate of 64.91~\si{\mega\hertz} has been demonstrated by the Munich Compact Light Source (MuCLS) \cite{eggl2016munich} using a two-bunch 4-mirror optical cavity -- a factor of 7 increase in average stored power. The stored laser power in the CBETA ICS system is therefore relatively conservative, however MuCLS uses a much lower repetition rate and a design with a larger laser focus so the conservative figure of 10~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power is appropriate for an ERL ICS demonstration.     

\section{Bypass Design}
\label{sec:bypass_design}

To utilize CBETA as an inverse Compton scattering source, a bypass line is required due to the stringent space restrictions in the existing FFA system; this leaves no space to arrange IP focusing, nor for the laser re-circulation cavity. The scattered photons from the ICS must also be produced in a different plane to the existing accelerator; the photons must be safely extracted from the footprint of the ERL since there is no space for an experimental hutch within the existing CBETA hall. This is evident upon inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_schematic}, the technical schematic of the CBETA accelerator and hall. From this diagram it is also clear that there is no scope to build a bypass line within the same plane as the existing accelerator due to space constraints.

\subsection{4th Turn ICS Bypass}

The layout of the designed bypass line is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Layout}, where the ICS bypass replaces the ordinary 4th pass of the CBETA ERL. The bypass is configured for 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th-pass operation but could be adapted to operate with all nominal energies through adjustment of the splitter and recombiner sections of the CBETA ERL; modification of the bypass to lower nominal energies is discussed in more detail at the end of this section. The bypass beamline was designed and optimised using the \textsc{Bmad} accelerator simulation library \cite{BmadManual} and the \textsc{Tao} program \cite{TaoManual} for simulating high
energy particle beams in accelerators.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Layout of the ICS bypass in CBETA; greyed beamline elements are already installed in the existing accelerator.

\label{fig:CBETA_ICS_Layout}
\end{figure}

The designed ICS bypass beamline diverts the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron beam after the 4th linac pass in the corresponding S4 splitter line; the electron beam then re-enters the existing layout in the R4 line. Therefore the bypass replaces the 4th pass of the FFA return loop, the S4 splitter (from the 4th dipole onward) and R4 recombiner (up to the 4th dipole). The bypass will be located above the existing permanent magnet arc as the original FFA arc transport of CBETA is still used to transport the lower energy (42, 78, and 114~MeV) beams before and after the bypass. For example, for ICS operation of CBETA using the 3rd turn nominal electron bunch energy ($E_{e} = 114$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}), the original FFA arc will be used to transport the first two turns -- the first and second pass as well as the fourth and fifth pass. 

All of the magnets within the CBETA ICS bypass have magnetic field strengths and gradients within the maxima of those already present in the CBETA ERL design. The maximum magnetic field gradient of any quadrupole is below $\sim15$~\si{\tesla}/\si{\meter} and the maximum dipole field used is below $\sim1$~\si{\tesla} which should be readily attainable and would allow the use of pre-existing magnet designs. Magnet specification is beyond the scope of this design though the field requirements of the ICS bypass magnets may be satisfied through conventional electromagnets. Hallbach permanent quadrupoles magnets, as used in the CBETA FFA design, would not be suitable as the ICS bypass requires tuning for each nominal electron bunch energy of CBETA. 

A system of vertical doglegs, replacing sections of the S4 and R4 lines where the bypass connects to the existing 4th turn of the CBETA ERL, are required to provide a 30~\si{\centi\meter} vertical elevation of the bypass line relative to the plane of the FFA return loop in order to avoid the existing accelerator. Single step vertical doglegs are preferred over the staircase style vertical doglegs used, for example in the CEBAF spreader \cite{york1987optics}, as they offer a smaller footprint which is desirable in a compact accelerator. However, this comes at the cost of increased dispersion growth and which increases $R_{56}$ more rapidly. Increased dispersion growth can be mitigated by additional focusing, though in the CBETA case additional focusing is not required as the vertical doglegs -- the area of vertical dispersion -- are short enough to limit the $R_{56}$ growth. Bypass arc sections using a quasi double bend achromat structure -- which is deficient from a true DBA structure as dispersion is not zeroed in each cell -- replace the existing FFA arc sections (FA, FB). Following the first arc, there is a horizontal dogleg used to zero the horizontal dispersion before the interaction region and offset the bypass from existing infrastructure. 

At the interaction region the beam is again offset upward locally by a further 20~\si{\centi\meter} -- to a 50~\si{\centi\meter} total vertical offset above the FFA reference orbit height -- using a pair of vertical doglegs, here named the IR doglegs. The further vertical offset is imposed so the photons are produced in a different plane to both the bypass line and FFA return loop, which is necessary for the extraction of the scattered x-ray beam to an external experimental hutch and to avoid irradiation of the FFA permanent magnets. As electrons circulate clockwise with reference to Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Layout} and the photons are backscattered, an experimental hutch would be placed to the left of this figure ($-x$ direction) where adequate space exists for an experimental end station. Design of the experimental hutch is beyond the scope of this design study. 

An adjustable focusing section within the pair of IR doglegs is used to focus to the required beam waist. The final focus section is designed to enable both $\beta^{*} = 1$~\si{\centi\meter} for the baseline case and $\beta^{*} = 12.7$~\si{\centi\meter} for the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth case (see Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters}). Further interaction point conditions require $\alpha_{x/y} =0$ and for the dispersion and it's derivative be zeroed ($\eta_{x/y} = 0$, $\eta'_{x/y} = 0$). The condition for $\alpha_{x/y} = 0$ arises from the design of the low $\beta$ insertion, and zeroed dispersion is necessary for the production of quasi-monochromatic scattered photons as well as maintaining a small beam spot size with no additional dispersive term (Eq.~\ref{eq:dispersive_beam_size}). The final focus section is based on a low $\beta$ insertion \cite{chao2013handbook} and is constructed from 7 quadrupoles with the laser re-circulation cavity placed between the adequately separated 4th and 5th quadrupoles. Quadrupole triplets are used to focus the bunch to the required small waist for interaction whilst the 7th IR quadrupole is used to aid optics matching of the outgoing interaction vertical dogleg. This scheme allows the photons to be extracted via the first dipole of the downstream IR dogleg, minimizing the number of magnets that require modification for photon extraction. 

For the 4th pass of CBETA, the total path length must be altered by $(n+1/2)\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ so the electron beam is decelerated in the subsequent pass. Small adjustments are typically made to the path length by the splitter/recombiner lines, however in the bypass design these have been bisected and can not accomplish this task. Therefore within the straight section of the bypass following the IR, variable path length adjustment is implemented based on a moving chicane described by H. Owen et al~\cite{owen2012modular}; this 4-dipole focusing chicane, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bypass_chicane_drawing}, uses two mechanically-adjustable swing arms each incorporating a quadrupole triplet, and a central bellows. The path length adjustment chicane is introduced to replicate the function of the S4/R4 splitter/recombiners to allow variation of both $R_{56}$ and path length for re-entry into the MLC. Path length adjustment is made by opening the swing arms of the chicane whilst increasing the dipole strengths accordingly. With this system a path length adjustment of $\pm\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ is possible, which corresponds to 180\si{\degree} of linac phase; more than adequate for adjustment of the bypass line. Over a change in path length of $\pm\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ the variation in Twiss values (after re-matching) is moderate, as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Twiss}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\caption{Schematic of a possible configuration of the adjustable bypass path length chicane.

Owen et al \cite{owen2012modular}.}
\label{fig:bypass_chicane_drawing}
\end{figure}

After path length adjustment there is a short $\sim5$~\si{\metre} transport section before the second arc. The second arc has a smaller radius of curvature than the first arc, but maintains dipole bending using reasonable strength magnets $B < 1$~\si{\tesla}. Again, the second arc is constructed using a similar quasi double bend achromat design to the first arc. After the arc there is a vertical dogleg which reverses the 30~\si{\centi\meter} offset of the bypass line re-introducing the electron bunch to the plane of the existing CBETA ERL whilst also zeroing the vertical dispersion. The vertical dogleg, in combination with the existing R4 splitter magnets are used to match the optics of the bypass to the pre-existing Twiss parameters and zero horizontal and vertical dispersion of the original 4th turn linac re-entry; hence the further decelerating passes remain unchanged from the original CBETA ERL configuration.   

The quality of the optical matching of the bypass is limited by the compact layout of CBETA, the conditions required for energy recovery of the interacted beam, re-entry from the bypass to the 5th linac pass (Twiss matching, $R_{56} =0$), and the necessity for the bypass to be constructed above the existing FFA return loop; the maximum $\beta$-functions and dispersion remain feasible throughout the ICS bypass. In the worst case scenario, a maximum $\beta$-function of $\beta_{y} = 150$~\si{\meter} is encountered, resulting in a 0.4~\si{\milli\meter} bunch radius which can be accommodated for by the standard 35~\si{\milli\meter} CBETA beam pipe radius. The dispersion in the $x$-plane has a maximum of $\eta_{x}\sim5$~\si{\meter} which is tolerable. This bypass design is intended as a proof of principle design, where further iterations could improve upon transport in the bypass. Plots of $\beta$-functions and dispersion in the bypass line for the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth case are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_Twiss} and~\ref{fig:CBETA_ICS_dispersion}.

A Gaussian bunch based on the CBETA ERL parameters at the exit of the linac on the 4th pass has been tracked using \textsc{Tao} \cite{TaoManual} from the exit of the linac, around the bypass lattice, to the IP and to the re-entry into the linac on the 5th pass. The tracking simulation was conducted neglecting collective effects such as coherent synchrotron radiation, space charge and beam breakup instability as they have all been the subject of study for the standard CBETA configuration \cite{hoffstaetter2017cbeta,lou2019beam,lou2020coherent}, with no large distortions of the electron distribution observed. Neglecting of collective effects is admissible for a first design study but would be the subject of future work on this topic. At the IP the Gaussian pulse shape is retained; the electron bunch distribution at the IP has been used in analysing the spectrum at the IP using the \textsc{ICCS3D} spectrum code \cite{krafft2016laser,ranjan2018simulation}.   

\subsection{Lower Electron Energy ICS Bypass}

The ICS bypass design for the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th turn could be generalised to the lower energy turns to form configurable ICS sources from each nominal energy. In this scheme, electron bunches would be re-routed through the S4 line, magnet strengths would be scaled and re-matched, the optimised IP focusing solution for each line, as in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters} would be adhered to, and the path length correction system would be adjusted to satisfy path length and $R_{56}$ constraints. Demonstration of a $\pm\lambda_{\mathrm{RF}}$ path length adjustment for the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th turn means greater flexibility for $\pm\lambda_{RF}$ adjustment at lower nominal energies is possible.

The 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} nominal energy beamline is at first glance the most challenging as this requires the highest gradient magnets for focusing at the IP, path length correction and transport. However, with a common transport ERL there is added complexity as beamlines are traversed twice in both acceleration and deceleration configuration. For example, the 3rd pass 114~\si{\mega\electronvolt} nominal energy transport line is traversed on both the 3rd turn (accelerating pass) and the 5th turn (decelerating pass). As the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th turn beamline is the maximum energy of the CBETA ERL, in standard 4-turn operation it is only traversed once in a decelerating configuration, which means this complexity is removed.

Added complexity occurs in lower turn ICS bypass beamlines because more transverse and longitudinal matching conditions must be satisfied. For example, if the ERL is still operated in 4-turn mode whilst the ICS source aims to operate using the 3rd turn 114~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch the bypass line must simultaneously be able to provide the electron bunch in an accelerating configuration into the linac at the end of the 3rd pass ($E_{e} = 114$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}), whilst also being able to provide the electron bunch into the linac on the 6th pass ($E_{e} = 78$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) in a decelerating configuration. The recirculating beamline is traversed twice and is unchanged on each passing. In addition, whilst satisfying the optical matching constraints, the bunch properties and focusing at the IP must remain identical, otherwise the spectral characteristics of the radiation produced will vary which is not ideal for light source operation. Satisfying these additional constraints may prove challenging.

The main challenge here is that in the ICS bypass for the lower turns of the ERL the electron bunch profile at the IP must be identical on each pass (accelerating and decelerating) of the turn in which the radiation is produced. This requirement originates as the spectrum of x-rays produced are dependent on the electron bunch profile. However, this requirement is unique to common transport. Using a single transport ERL, the ICS interaction point is only traversed once as each pass is only traversed once, which avoids the requirement to have identical bunch profiles at the IP from the accelerating an decelerating passes. Therefore, single transport ERLs may be more appropriate for integrating ICS sources or other insertion devices into ERLs. 


\section{Spectral Output}
\label{sec:CBETA_spectral_output}

In order to determine the performance of the CBETA inverse Compton scattering source, the predicted spectral output of the source -- several measures quantifying the output radiation -- must be characterised using the formulae in Chapter~\ref{Photon_Production_by_Inverse_Compton_Scattering}. Anticipated spectral output of the CBETA inverse Compton scattering source is denoted in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}, where the spectral output of the baseline and the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth round-beam optimised configurations are both shown based upon the proposed electron bunch parameters (Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters}) and laser pulse parameters (Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}) in Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_electron_laser_parameters}. The (average and peak) brilliance and spectral density have been calculated for the baseline case. The collimated flux can only be calculated for the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth configuration because the baseline case is used to define the full, uncollimated radiation spectrum.

\begin{table}[!h]
\caption{Anticipated photon output for each of the four nominal electron beam energies in CBETA, taking into account a 5~degree crossing angle. The recoil parameter is negligible $X < 0.003$, even at  150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} -- the maximum electron beam energy. The collimated flux has been optimised for a 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth and the baseline case focuses at the IP to $\beta^{*} =1$~\si{\centi\meter} for each nominal energy.}

\label{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}
\end{table}

From Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}, it is evident that uncollimated flux varies by around 2\% due to the small effect of the varying electron spot size. Recoil effects, as described in Section~\ref{sec:electron_photon_interactions}, are negligible even at the highest electron beam energy $E_{e} = 150$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}, as $X = 2.70\times 10^{-3}$. The number of photons scattered in the interactions are essentially independent of electron energy for a fixed electron spot size at the IP, and this is also similarly evident in the collimated flux at each electron energy. 

The crossing angle ($\phi=5$~\si{degree}) causes only a $\sim 1$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} reduction in the Compton edge scattered photon energy (Eq.~\ref{eq:scattered_photon_energy}) in comparison to the head-on case ($\phi = 0$). However, the crossing angle impacts the flux of the source significantly as the effective time over which incident laser photons may interact with the electrons in the counter propagating bunch is reduced. For the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch the angular crossing (Eq.~\ref{eq:angular_crossing_factor}) results in a factor of $R_{AC} = 5.56$ reduction in luminosity due to a 5\si{\degree} crossing angle  -- a substantial reduction in flux. 

The scattered photon energy of the source is independent of the hourglass effect -- the reduction in luminosity due to the geometrical divergence of the beams at the IP \cite{furman1991hourglass} -- but the hourglass effect impacts upon the luminosity of the source and therefore the flux; the hourglass effect luminosity reduction (Eq.~\ref{eq:furman_hourglass_reduction}) is $R_{HG} = 0.96$, a 4\% reduction in flux for the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch in a head-on ($\phi=0$) back-scattering arrangement. However, the angular crossing and hourglass effect affect the ICS source simultaneously so the full combined reduction factor $R_{ACHG}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:miyahara_combined_reduction}) must account for both simultaneously, resulting in a factor $R_{ACHG} = 5.57$ reduction for the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch. For the CBETA ICS source, the value of the combined luminosity reduction factor (Eq.~\ref{eq:miyahara_combined_reduction}) is  near-identical to the angular crossing reduction factor (Eq.~\ref{eq:angular_crossing_factor}) as the hourglass effect is suppressed by the reduction in interaction time of the electron bunch and laser pulse. 

Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output} also shows both the peak and average brilliance of the source, which increase with nominal energy due to the $\mathcal{B} \propto \gamma^{2}$ relationship -- which is explicitly shown in (Eq.~\ref{eq:average_brilliance_compact}) -- which is due to the Lorentz contraction of the phase space of the output radiation.  Similarly, the spectral density decreases approximately inversely proportional to the square of the Lorentz factor of the electron beam ($S \propto 1/\gamma^{2}$) because of the double Doppler shift in the scattered photon energy (Eq.~\ref{eq:scattered_photon_energy}). 

The round beam optimisation in Section~\ref{sec:RB_optimisation} has been applied to maximise the collimated flux within an \textit{rms} bandwidth in the range 0--1\% for each of the four nominal energies of the CBETA ERL, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve}. The tuning curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve} is the Pareto-optimal front of the collimated flux--\textit{rms} bandwidth, which corresponds to the parameter space runing curves for each electron energy in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_beta_theta_parameter_space}. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Figures/CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design/CBETA150_RB_Fcol_BW.pdf}
\caption{Tuning curve of collimated flux against \textit{rms} bandwidth for a 0--1\% \textit{rms} bandwidth range, produced by a round beam optimisation which tunes $\beta^{*}$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$. The tuning curve is independent of beam energy for scattering scenarios with small recoil ($X \ll 1$), hence this tuning curve applies to all energies in CBETA. The left end of tuning curve indicates the minimum possible \textit{rms} bandwidth of the ICS source, which in CBETA is $\simeq$~0.12\% and is determined by the electron beam and laser pulse energy spreads.}
\label{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve}, the round beam optimisation tuning curves of the four nominal energies of the CBETA ICS are shown as a single line because the recoil parameter for the CBETA ICS is near-negligible ($X<3\times 10^{-3}$) for the nominal operating energies of CBETA, which means the tuning curves overlap. The tuning curve is independent of electron bunch energy, as the collimated flux (Eq.~\ref{eq:collimated_flux}) is near-independent of electron bunch energy and the recoil is small. 

The relationship between collimated flux and bandwidth for the CBETA ICS is generally linear though, at low bandwidth ($\Delta E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}<0.17$\%), the collimated flux appears to decrease non-linearly. Below $E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}<0.17$\%, the energy spreads of the electron bunch and laser pulse (spectral bandwidth) begin to dominate the bandwidth, which severely restricts the round beam $\beta^{*}$--$\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ parameter space. Consequently, the optimum balance between the emittance (Eq.~\ref{eq:emittance_term_round_beam}) and collimation (Eq.~\ref{eq:collimation_term}) terms in the bandwidth can not be achieved, causing a rapid decrease in the collimated flux. The minimum limit of the bandwidth (Eq.~\ref{eq:bandwidth_limitation_minimum}) given by
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{\Delta E_{\gamma}}{E_{\gamma}}\right)_{\mathrm{min}} = \sqrt{2\left(\frac{\Delta E_{e}}{E_{e}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta E_{L}}{E_{L}}\right)}   
\end{equation*}
in the low recoil limit ($X \ll 1$), which occurs when the energy spread of the electron bunch $\left(\Delta E_{e}/E_{e}\right)$ and the spectral bandwidth of the laser pulse $\left(\Delta E_{L}/E_{L}\right)$ dominate the bandwidth. Since the energy spread of the electron bunch and laser pulse spectral bandwidth do not vary in the optimisation, this places a limit on the CBETA ICS source of $\left(\Delta E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}\right)_{\mathrm{min}}=1.2\times 10^{-3}$ i.e a 0.12\% \textit{rms} bandwidth.

The spectrum of the scattered x-rays produced from a single head-on ($\phi = 0$) CBETA ICS interaction of a 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch and laser pulse, collimated downstream into a 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth, with electron bunch and laser pulse parameters presented in Tables~\ref{tab:CBETA_electron_beam_design_parameters} and \ref{tab:CBETA_laser_pulse_design_parameters}, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking}. The spectrum in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking} is produced using two individual semi-analytical spectrum codes: \textsc{ICARUS}, the development of which is covered in Section~\ref{sec:development_of_the_ICARUS_spectrum_code}, and \textsc{ICCS3D} \cite{krafft2016laser,ranjan2018simulation}. Both spectrum codes are described in detail in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}. The \textsc{ICARUS} spectrum is produced using Gaussian models for the electron bunch and laser pulse whereas \textsc{ICCS3D} uses a Gaussian electron bunch distribution that has been tracked using \textsc{Tao} \cite{TaoManual} through CBETA ICS bypass, as detailed in Section~\ref{sec:bypass_design}, to the interaction point. Both codes simulate the recoil effect, account for emittance in both transverse planes, model the effect of energy spread of the electron bunch and laser pulse (spectral bandwidth) and are capable of simulating both square and circular collimation. The CBETA ICS \textsc{ICARUS} and \textsc{ICCS3D} spectra show good agreement as also observed during the benchmarking of the three test cases in Section~\ref{sec:benchmarking_of_the_ICARUS_spectrum_code}.

This spectrum has a peak energy of 403.3~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}; using the proposed 5\si{\degree} crossing angle, the peak energy is reduced to 402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} and the spectral density is reduced by a factor $\sim$~5.56.}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking} the case of the CBETA ICS at 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} is shown with a scattered photon energy of 403.3~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} at the Compton edge, 0.8~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} above the value shown in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output} because the spectrum is for the head-on case. The Compton edge energy of the spectrum ($E_{\gamma}403.3$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) is located at the peak spectral density (intensity). The maximum scattered photon energy in the spectrum ($E_{\gamma}\approx405$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) in the spectrum exceeds the predicted Compton edge energy (Eq.~\ref{eq:compton_edge_energy}) at peak intensity because of the energy spread of the electron bunch and the spectral bandwidth of the laser pulse, which mean that an incident electron or photon can have a higher energy photon that the nominal energy -- the high scattered photon energy tail is a pure energy spread effect.


The spectral density of the spectrum is truncated due to collimation, which excludes lower energy photons. The low energy tail occurs due to the energy spread of the electron bunch and laser pulse spectral bandwidth combined with the emittance. Electron bunch energy spread and laser pulse spectral bandwidth mean the incident electron or photon can be lower energy than the nominal electron bunch energy, which results in lower energy scattered photons being generated. The transverse emittance of the electron bunch varies the divergence of the scattered radiation and therefore allows lower energy photons to pass through the collimator. Hence, the two combine to create a low energy tail.

The round beam optimisation method in Section~\ref{sec:RB_optimisation} maximises the collimated flux, and therefore the spectral density, in a \textit{rms} bandwidth. Hence, for a particular bandwidth, the spectrum shows the maximum intensity for the ICS source and its distribution as a function of scattered photon energy. A collimated flux of $1.99\times 10^{9}$~ph/\si{\second} is calculated via the \textsc{ICARUS} spectrum in a head-on interaction for the 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth using RB optimisation, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking}. Upon inspection of Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}, the collimated flux of the \textsc{ICARUS} simulation is in very good agreement with the analytical collimated flux formula (Eq.~\ref{eq:collimated_flux}), where the collimated flux in a RB optimised 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth is $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{col}} = 3.57\times 10^{8}$~ph/\si{\second}, once the \textsc{ICARUS} value is adjusted by the angular crossing luminosity reduction factor (Eq.~\ref{eq:angular_crossing_factor})
\begin{align*}
\frac{\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{col}}^{\mathrm{ICARUS}}}{R_{AC}} &= \frac{1.99\times 10^{9}}{5.56} = 3.58\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{ph/\si{\second}}, \\
\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{col}}^{\mathrm{analytical}} &= 3.57\times 10^{8}~\mathrm{ph/\si{\second}}.
\label{eq:CBETA_ICARUS_yield}    
\end{align*}
A small difference is expected between the two values, as the ICARUS code accounts for energy spread of the electron bunch and spectral bandwidth of the laser pulse.

\section{X-ray ICS Source Comparison}
\label{sec:xray_ICS_comparison}

Many inverse Compton scattering sources, driven by a variety of accelerator types, have been designed and built to operate in the x-ray regime; the CBETA ICS can be compared against these to evaluate the benefit of the ERL approach. Direct comparison is difficult as different designs have different objectives -- one design may prioritize maximizing flux while another prioritizes a narrower bandwidth. Sources may also take different approaches to the interaction laser such as ICS sources that take advantage of high repetition rates via re-circulating a more modest energy laser pulse, with a focus on high average brilliance, and those that use high laser pulse energies, short pulses and low repetition rates, with a focus on high peak brilliance.  

To collate ICS sources of interest, we arbitrarily limit our discussions to the scattered photon energy range $1$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} ($\sim$10~\si{\angstrom}) $< E_{\gamma} <$ 1~\si{\mega\electronvolt} ($\sim$0.01~\si{\angstrom}); very low flux ($\mathcal{F} < 10^{3}$~ph/\si{s}) ICS sources are neglected. A brief survey of x-ray inverse Compton sources is presented in Table~\ref{tab:xray_ICS_comparison}.

\end{table}

The 3rd and 4th pass ICS sources on CBETA nominally produce x-rays at 233~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} and 403~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} respectively, therefore the CBETA ICS source offers unparalleled access to the $E_{\gamma} > 200$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} x-ray regime, enabling a series of new high energy x-ray applications as shown in Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_ICS_applications}. Few other ICS sources operate within the 200~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}--1~\si{\mega\electronvolt} scattered photon energy range.

The highest flux x-ray ICS demonstration is the 1.78$\times 10^{10}$~ph/\si{\second} demonstration at MuCLS \cite{eggl2016munich}, which uses a small ($\sim4$~\si{\meter} diameter) storage ring and a 70~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power Fabry-Perot optical cavity. The CBETA ICS source design excels the MuCLS flux by a factor $\sim2$ because of a higher repetition rate ($162.5$~\si{\mega\hertz}$>64.91$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) and the small emittance ($\epsilon_{n}=0.3$~\si{\milli\meter}--\si{\milli\radian}) of CBETA. However, CBETA ICS is also capable of a much smaller bandwidth due to the smaller energy spread and emittance of the ERL in comparison with the MuCLS storage ring. The CBETA ICS design outclasses the cERL ICS demonstration, the previous leading high flux ERL driven ICS source, in terms of flux by a factor of $\sim1000$. As the Fabry-Perot optical cavity for CBETA is based upon the cERL ICS design, the difference is mainly due to the increase in bunch charge of CBETA in comparison to cERL (32~\si{\pico\coulomb} $>$ 0.355~\si{\pico\coulomb}) and the smaller electron bunch spot size at the interaction point (for the baseline case). Therefore, with a high brightness electron beam the ERL approach is competitive with the storage ring approach and offers advantages in narrow bandwidth operation. 

The design of the BriXS and ThomX ICS sources could achieve fluxes up to $10^{13}$~ph/\si{\second}, which are a factor $\sim300$ higher than those predicted for the CBETA ICS. 

In the BriXS case this is because the push-pull ERL design expects a much higher bunch charge than CBETA (32~\si{\pico\coulomb} < 200~\si{\pico\coulomb}) \cite{drebot2019brixs} and the average stored laser power at 750~\si{\kilo\watt} \cite{drebot2019brixs} is a factor $75$ greater than the CBETA ICS proposal. A 750~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power is beyond the the 670~\si{\kilo\watt} highest average stored power demonstration \cite{carstens2014megawatt} for an optical cavity. Therefore, the increase in flux of the BriXS design dependent on an undemonstrated optical cavity whereas the CBETA ICS source is based upon demonstrated laser parameters.

The ThomX source intends to increase its flux, by increasing the bunch charge, repetition frequency and stored laser power $P_{\mathrm{avg}}$ (in the Fabry--Perot cavity), in three steps \cite{dupraz2020thomx}: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Stage 1 ($\mathcal{F}=10^{10}$~ph/\si{\second}): $Q=50$~\si{\pico\coulomb}, $P_{\mathrm{avg}}=100$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} -- .}
    \item{Stage 2 ($\mathcal{F}=10^{11}$~ph/\si{\second}): $Q=100$~\si{\pico\coulomb}, $P_{\mathrm{avg}} = 500$~\si{\kilo\watt}. \\ (repetition rate increased five-fold).}
    \item{Stage 3 ($\mathcal{F}=10^{13}$~ph/\si{\second}): $Q=1$~\si{\nano\coulomb}, $P_{\mathrm{avg}} = 1$~\si{\mega\watt}.}
\end{enumerate}
A stored laser power of 1~\si{\mega\watt} is undemonstrated, and a factor of $100$ larger than the CBETA parameters based on the cERL demonstrated optical cavity \cite{akagi2016narrow}. The ThomX collaboration have demonstrated a 383~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power cavity \cite{liu2018optical} separately to the operation of the accelerator which could affect stability of the optical cavity via vibration etc. The 383~\si{\kilo\watt} average stored power ThomX cavity is undemonstrated for ICS production which exceeds the  70~\si{\kilo\watt} MuCLS \cite{eggl2016munich} optical cavity which has been demonstrated.

\section{Synchrotron Facility Comparison}
\label{sec:synchrotron_facility_comparison}

Inverse Compton production of photons at CBETA has the ability to extend the reach of monochromatic photon sources toward \si{\mega\electronvolt} scale, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:CBETA_spectral_output}, operating in the high energy x-ray regime. Alternative sources of x-rays are bremsstrahlung methods, though these generate intrinsically broad-band radiation, line sources such as $^{137}$Cs and $^{60}$Co, and synchrotron radiation. Whilst line sources provide photons in the \si{\mega\electronvolt} scale, they are not tuneable, emit isotropically and require favoured handling (constant emission). Therefore, synchrotron radiation sources such as undulators are currently the premier method to generate intense, narrow-band radiation tunable on a \si{\kilo\electronvolt} to \si{\mega\electronvolt} scale. Hence, evaluation of the CBETA ICS as a source of monochromatic x-ray radiation is best attained by direct comparison with leading synchrotron radiation sources as well as other inverse Compton scattering sources (Section~\ref{sec:xray_ICS_comparison}). A discussion on bremsstrahlung and line source radiation generation is consequently suspended until discussion of $\gamma$-ray ICS source in the DIANA $\gamma$-ray ICS source design in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}, where the $\gamma$-ray photons ($E_{\gamma} > 1$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) can not be readily generated by synchrotron radiation.   

Krafft and Priebe \cite{krafft2010compton} proposed that flux and brilliance offered by ICS sources is not competitive at the photon energies accessible with 3rd generation light sources such as synchrotron radiation facilities. Recent x-ray ICS source designs are intended to compromise between typical laboratory-scale sources, such as rotating anode tubes, and synchrotron radiation facilities in terms of size, cost, access, availability, and x-ray quality \cite{deitrick2018high}. The CBETA ICS source design provides scope to test Krafft and Priebe's hypothesis because it spans to the 100's~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} regime with comparable flux to other ICS sources, as shown in Section~\ref{sec:xray_ICS_comparison}, which allows better assessment of the utility of ICS production at the limits of synchrotron production.

Firstly, the limitations of the synchrotron radiation approach must be characterised. The characteristic critical photon energy for synchrotron radiation is
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{c}=\frac{3}{2}\frac{\hbar c \gamma^3}{\rho},
\label{eq:synchrotron_critical_energy}
\end{equation}
which can be recast in more natural units as $\epsilon_{c}$[\si{\kilo\electronvolt}]$\simeq 0.665E^{2}B$ (for $E$, the electron kinetic energy, given in \si{\giga\electronvolt} and $B$, the magnetic flux density of the bending magnets, in \si{\tesla}). The highest-energy 3rd-generation light source source today is SPring-8 with $E = 8$~\si{\giga\electronvolt} and $B\simeq 0.68$~\si{\tesla} to obtain a critical energy $\epsilon_{c}\simeq 29$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} for broadband incoherent SR production. Storage rings for 3rd generation light sources, such as SPring-8, have a physical circumference exceeding 1~\si{\kilo\meter} therefore due to financial considerations it is unlikely that a storage ring above 8~\si{\giga\electronvolt} will be built. Therefore, $\sim30$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} is a realistic limitation on the maximum photon energy produced by the fundamental harmonic of a 3rd generation light source.

The undulator minimum wavelength limit from a storage ring can be illustrated by setting the undulator $K$-parameter to be $K\sim 1$ and an undulator period $\lambda_u\sim$~1~\si{\centi\meter}. This gives a magnetic field of
\begin{equation}
B_{0} = \frac{m_{e} c}{e}\frac{2\pi}{\lambda_{u}} K \simeq 1\textrm{T}.
\label{eq:undulator_field_limit}
\end{equation}
The minimum undulator wavelength ($K=0$) possible (in the fundamental harmonic of emission) is
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\textrm{min} = \frac{\lambda_{u}}{2 \gamma^2} \simeq 0.2 \textrm{\AA}
\label{eq:undulator_minimum_wavelength}
\end{equation}
at 8~\si{\giga\electronvolt} ($\gamma \sim 15,700$), corresponding to a photon energy of $62$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. The electron energy limit of 8~\si{\giga\electronvolt} is imposed as this is the electron beam energy of the SPring-8 synchrotron source \cite{spring8beamlines}, with the highest electron bunch energy of any current synchrotron source. In practice, most hard x-ray undulators and wigglers operate up to around 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} photon energy by using higher harmonics, with few existing beamlines extending beyond that. Undulator output at higher harmonics has a photon energy limited predominantly by the presence of magnetic phase errors, and the reduction factor $R$ in ideal flux from an \textit{rms} phase error $\sigma_{\phi}$ can be modelled approximately \cite{walker1993interference} using 
\begin{equation}
R=\exp{\left(-n^2 \sigma_{\phi}^{2}\right)},
\label{eq:undulator_phase_errors}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is an integer (odd) undulator harmonic number, and $\sigma_\phi$ typically has a value of a few degrees \cite{walker2013phase}. In practice magnetic phase errors limit undulators in operation to the $n<15$ harmonics, although there is still debate on the pessimism of the \textit{rms} error in some cases \cite{tanaka2018universal} and around schemes for reduction of $\sigma_{\phi}$ future insertion devices \cite{hwang2011development,huang2017challenges}.

Hard x-ray sources presently available at the high-energy storage rings APS \cite{apsbeamlines}, ESRF-EBS \cite{esrfbeamlines}, PETRA-III \cite{petraiiibeamlines}, and SPring-8 \cite{spring8beamlines}, have been surveyed. The codes \textsc{SPECTRA} \cite{tanaka2001spectra} and \textsc{SRW} \cite{chubar2013wavefront} are used to validate expected spectral output \cite{tanaka2001field} of these synchrotron sources. For example, the flux of the SPring-8 BL10XU beamline subject to a reasonable 5\si{\degree} \textit{rms} phase error is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}; this is compared with sample fluxes at the source points presented by SPring-8 \cite{spring8beamlines} and with the predicted uncollimated flux in a 0.1\% \textit{FWHM} bandwidth (Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_0.1_bandwidth}) from the CBETA ICS source design. A 0.1\% \textit{FWHM} bandwidth is used as a conventional performance parameter for synchrotron light source as this characterises the narrowband portion of the radiation spectrum most exploited by users.

The undulator shown is the SPring-8 BL10XU insertion device \cite{spring8beamlines} assuming an \textit{rms} phase error of 5\si{\degree}. Whilst this undulator is not designed to deliver good output at high harmonic number, it offers a useful guide to possible 3rd-generation source output in the 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} to 500~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} range. The measured flux at 30~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} and 61~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} for this beamline is also shown \cite{spring8beamlines}. We predict that CBETA flux at 402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} (150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron energy) exceeds that from 3rd-generation sources.}
\label{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}
\end{figure}

The predicted average brilliance of the CBETA ICS source at the nominal energies of each turn is compared in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Brilliance} with a high-energy undulator (BL10XU) at SPring-8 -- the worlds highest-energy 3rd-generation synchrotron source. Because the SPring-8 BL10XU undulator is not atypical, Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Brilliance} is indicative of achievable brilliance from other state-of-the-art synchrotron facilities. This statement also holds for the case of the spectral flux (Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_0.1_bandwidth}) in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design/spring8bl10brillianceplot.pdf}

We predict that CBETA brilliance at 402~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} (150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron kinetic energy) exceeds that from 3rd generation sources.}
\label{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Brilliance}
\end{figure}

As proposed by Krafft and Priebe \cite{krafft2010compton}, storage ring sources produce greater brilliance and flux at high harmonic number for photon energies up to approximately 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. However, the fundamental energy scaling of synchrotron radiation and the finite undulator magnetic field quality means that the ICS output from CBETA becomes superior beyond 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. From Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}, the measured synchrotron flux at 30~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} and 61~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} \cite{spring8beamlines} is orders of magnitude superior to that from an ICS source, but at 400~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} this is reversed. From inspection of other ICS source designs in Table~\ref{tab:xray_ICS_comparison}, it is evident that ICS sources are projected to achieve $\sim 10^{10} - 10^{13}$~ph/\si{\second} quasi-independently of scattered photon energy so the conclusion can be broadened to state that the interface between utility of ICS sources and 3rd generation light sources lies at $E_{\gamma}\sim 300$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}. Therefore, the hypothesis of Krafft and Priebe \cite{krafft2010compton} must be modified accordingly.

This is compared with the predicted CBETA outputs using (Eq.~\ref{eq:flux_0.1_bandwidth}), at the 4 discrete photon energies from 32 to 402~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, and the predicted flux obtained by scaling the CBETA electron energy to 300~\si{\mega\electronvolt} (1.60~\si{\mega\electronvolt} photons) and 600~\si{\mega\electronvolt} (6.36~\si{\mega\electronvolt} photons). Whilst 3rd generation sources are superior to ICS sources up to photon energies around 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, no synchrotron light source produces useable flux above 400~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}.}
\label{fig:ICS_Undulator_Comparison}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_Undulator_Comparison} compares the on-sample measured fluxes from those high-energy synchrotron beamlines ($>$30~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) for which data is available \cite{apsbeamlines,esrfbeamlines,petraiiibeamlines,spring8beamlines}. Few synchrotron beamlines generate radiation above 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, and above 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} we have shown that ICS is a superior production method. Extending the demonstrated CBETA parameters to higher electron energy we would expect the collimated flux values to remain nearly constant as we see that flux in inverse Compton scattering sources is broadly independent of electron kinetic energy. Hence we can estimate the likely possible flux for \si{\mega\electronvolt}-scale photons from a CBETA style ERL-based source. Two indicative electron energies (300~\si{\mega\electronvolt} and 600~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) are included in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_Undulator_Comparison}. The fluxes at 100's~\si{\mega\electronvolt}, based on a conservatively designed multi-pass ERL ICS, highlight the potential of this approach to $\gamma$-ray sources. 

\section{CBETA ICS Applications}
\label{sec:CBETA_ICS_applications}

\textcolor{blue}{**WAIT FOR CARLS REPLY**}

The proposed CBETA ICS design provides a high-flux, tuneable, quasi-monochromatic source of x-rays, producing high peak energy photons in the 100's~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} range. Large flux ($\sim 10^{10}$ph/\si{\second}) at high energies ($< 100$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) opens up a parameter space for x-ray applications previously attainable only at the largest synchrotrons and using substantial x-ray optics such as monochromators \cite{caciuffo1987monochromators}. Section~\ref{sec:synchrotron_facility_comparison} has shown that the CBETA ICS can achieve fluxes of $3.16\times 10^{10}$~ph/\si{\second} up to 402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, beyond that possible at synchrotron radiation facilities, therefore enabling new applications. Within this section an overview of the potential applications of the CBETA ICS are presented.   

Scattered photon beams produced by the CBETA ICS source could be used in important applications such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) \cite{willmott2019introduction}. A simple diagram of an x-ray resonant fluorescence experiment is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:XRF_diagram}. Energy-sensitive x-ray fluorescence detection can be provided by a solid-state detector coupled to a pulse-height analyzer. For example, in analysis of a fission reactor's fuel rods, the $K\alpha$ and $K\beta$ lines for uranium ($K\alpha_{1} = 98.4$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, $K\beta_{1} = 111.3$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) and plutonium ($K\alpha_{1} = 103.7$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, $K\beta_{1} = 117.2$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) could be probed \cite{havrilla2015feasibility}. Quantitative assays and elemental determination would be performed through use of a low-$Z$ reference scatterer -- such as Kapton -- to ascertain the spectral content of the broadband incident beam via the elastic and Compton scattering into the same detector. The detected spectrum of the ICS source would first be measured using XRF of a Kapton foil and known energy dependent photo-absorption cross sections of the Kapton sample would enable determination of the fluorescence efficiency of the detection scheme for elements of interest. The experiment repeated with a sample of interest such as the uranium fuel rods, to provide an x-ray resonance fluorescence measurement that could be corrected from the ICS source spectrum.

\label{fig:CRF_diagram}
\end{figure}

High energy photon production from the CBETA ICS source allows imaging of thick specimens, with monochromatic photons, as the penetration depth of x-ray radiation increases with photon energy. The CBETA ICS source could therefore be a prime tool to apply straightforward techniques such as 2D shadowgraphy  to more complex 3D reconstruction with tomography \cite{als2011elements} to thick samples -- on the \si{\centi\meter}-scale at CHESS \cite{miller2017insitmu}.  For example, inverse Compton scattering x-rays have been applied to lithium battery material studies \cite{suzuki2015extracting,suzuki2016non,suzuki2019high}, where a higher energy is advantageous over other spectroscopies as it
allows a bulk-sensitive measurement of a disordered system
under sample conditions of temperature, magnetic field,
and pressure and also enables measurement of a sample inside a metal
container, which can be penetrated by high-energy x-rays \cite{suzuki2015extracting}. For example, the mass attenuation coefficient $\mu/\rho_{m}$ for 304 stainless steel \cite{thyssenkrupp2021steel} (a common battery housing material) at various energies is: 25.64~\si{\gram}/\si{\centi\meter}$^{2}$ (20~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}), 0.37~\si{\gram}/\si{\centi\meter}$^{2}$ (100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) and 0.09~\si{\gram}/\si{\centimeter}$^{2}$ (402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) \cite{berger1999xcom} -- CBETA would enable a $\sim 4$ fold increase in penetration power from a typical 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} synchrotron beamline. Therefore, the higher photon energies enabled by the CBETA ICS could extend the range of experiments conducted at existing synchrotron radiation facilities.

Energy-dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDXRD), used for the identification of constituents of a poly-crystalline or powdered sample, is another application which exploits the high flux and high energy an ICS source. A simple schematic of an EDXRD experimental setup is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:EDXRD_diagram}, the experiment is performed for a fixed diffraction into a fixed angle $\Upsilon$. A high-flux source would allow for rapid identification of the minerals in a mined ore sample, while again the high energy of the source allows for the inspection of thick specimens. For commercial applications, the compact nature of the CBETA ICS is also advantageous. In EDXRD \cite{kampfe2005energy} one applies the non-monochromated peak to a specimen of the material of interest, and checks for diffracted photons with an energy-sensitive solid-state detector. From the diffracted photon energy the wavelength can be deduced, and via application of the Bragg relation a combination of Miller indices and lattice spacing of the reflecting crystalline planes is returned. Survey of many crystalline plane reflections in a particular mineral provides constituent identification; the intensity of these Bragg peaks provides the relative abundances of the various mineral components.

We also consider applications that would require significant beamline infrastructure in contrast to previously discussed applications. Non-resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (NIXS) \cite{isaacs1996inelastic} could be performed to examine the dynamic electronic response of materials. A schematic of a non-resonant inelastic scattering experiment is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:NIXS_diagram}. The inherent high scattered photon energy and large flux of the CBETA ICS sources allows experimentation of novel materials such as transition metal oxides, which provide insight into high-temperature superconductor candidates \cite{hasan2002momentum,isaacs1996inelastic}. Experimental test of the Mott-Hubbard model \cite{hubbard1963electron,mott1949basis} could also be accomplished via the application of high photon energy NIXS to transition metal oxides \cite{isaacs1996resonant}. The Mott-Hubbard model is a lattice model of a solid, modelling correlated (strongly interacting) electrons in a solid via pairs of repulsing electrons which contribute to the potential term of the Hamiltonian in the model. The Mott-Hubbard model is useful to describe materials with open $d$ and $f$ shells, such as the transition metal oxides, where narrow orbitals cause highly correlated electron behaviour unexplained by other methods \cite{kotliar2004strongly}.

The energy resolution requirements for NIXS are severe -- 1~\si{\electronvolt} out of 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} i.e $10^{-5}$ \textit{FWHM} bandwidth -- though the minimum theoretical \textit{FWHM} bandwidth of the CBETA ICS is $2.8\times 10^{-3}$. Therefore a high-energy x-ray monochromator and analyzer optics must be developed to enable this application. A possible route to the stringent monochromator conditions is via a synthetic multi-layer construction \cite{andre2002x}, used to provide an optimal match to x-ray beam optics. For an implementation of the NIXS technique at the CBETA ICS the analyzers would be arrayed at a range of scattering angles for measurement of a comprehensive set of momentum transfers, as the momentum transfer between the solid and the x-ray probe will vary with angle. The pass energy -- for collection in the detector -- of the analyzers is fixed while the incident energy -- of the photon on the sample -- is scanned to provide variable energy transfers with a double crystal monochromator configuration \cite{schulke2007electron,fister2006multielement}. Because of sample self absorption and the weak signal set by the small Thomson cross section \cite{schulke2007electron}, further reduced by monochromation requirements (the no. photons in a $10^{-5}$ bandwidth is severly limited), the applicability of NIXS to medium to large Z elements is limited. Performance of NIXS at an incident energy of 100~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} as proposed here would provide an attenuation length due to photo-absorption of 100~\si{\micro\meter}. This is a factor of 25 greater \cite{TungstenGraph} than that provided at the contemporary hard NIXS facility at the Advanced Photon Source \cite{fister2006multielement}, which operates with an incident energy of 10~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} when performing spectroscopy with the low energy transfers widely used in condensed matter studies.  

\section{Summary}

In summary, the retrofittable CBETA ICS source design study has shown that the ERL driven ICS approach is capable of delivering a high flux ($\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{col}} =$ 3.68--3.57$\times 10^{8}$~ph/\si{\second}) of high energy x-rays ($E_{\gamma} =$ 32.2--402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}) within a narrow bandwidth ($\left(\Delta E_{\gamma}/E_{\gamma}\right)_{\mathrm{rms}} = 0.5$\%). A bypass line to the CBETA multi-turn ERL has been designed for production of photons from 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunches in CBETA, with tunable focusing which could be extended to each of the other nominal energies of the CBETA ERL. In comparison with other designed and demonstrated ICS sources, as shown by Table~\ref{tab:xray_ICS_comparison}, the CBETA ICS is comparable in flux and extends upward the scattered photon energy range of conventional x-ray ICS sources. The multi-turn ERL design of CBETA has been shown to be an effective route to a multi-coulour ICS source. 

A prototype design of a bypass beamline to the existing CBETA ERL has been shown, which allows for RB optimised operation of the ICS source at the maximum 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} kinetic energy. The bypass design satisfies conditions imposed by a multi-turn ERL such as path length and $R_{56}$ adjustment, whilst providing tunable focusing at the IP and adhering to reasonable magnet specifications. Discussion is included on extension of this bypass design to a multi-colour x-ray ICS source.  

At the specified design parameters, the CBETA narrowband high energy x-ray ICS source could facilitate a wide variety of experiments typically only available at a synchrotron light source, whilst allowing for experiments requiring high energy photons such as thick specimen experimentation in fields such as lithium battery development and nuclear waste management. Comparative studies with synchrotron sources in Section~\ref{sec:synchrotron_facility_comparison} have demonstrated that above $\sim300$~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} synchrotron light source facilities excelled by the x-ray flux available at ICS sources within this energy range. An ICS source at CBETA would increase the photon energy reach of the CHESS \cite{CHESSstructuralmaterialsbeamline} synchrotron, with flux unattainable at any comparable ICS source or synchrotron source.  

The CBETA ICS source has shown capabilities of inverse Compton scattering sources to deliver high energy, narrow bandwidth x-ray beams
at high flux. Higher energy electron beams ($E_{e}<250$~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) could extend this approach to the \si{\mega\electronvolt}-scale, where narrowband $\gamma$-ray production is currently unavailable due to the broadband limitations of Bremsstrahlung source. Comparison of the x-ray flux and bandwidth at each nominal energy of the CBETA ICS shows this remains relatively unchanged with energy which means similar narrow bandwidth and high flux is achievable for a $\gamma$-ray ICS source. Consequently, the ERL driven ICS approach is a premier candidate for narrowband $\gamma$-ray production, which motivated further investigation of \si{\mega\electronvolt}-scale ICS sources in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}.
