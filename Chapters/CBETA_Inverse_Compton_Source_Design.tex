\caption{Tuning curves of $\beta^{*}$ against $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$ for each of the nominal CBETA electron beam energies satisfying the maximal flux across the 0--1\% bandwidth range. Minimised bandwidth solutions in this range have large $\beta$-functions at the IP and small collimation angles $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$; the maximal bandwidth solutions have small $\beta$-functions and larger collimation angles $\theta_{\mathrm{col}}$.\textcolor{blue}{**THIS SHOULD BE REPLACED BY ONE FROM NEW CODE WITH LESS NOISE**}}

Predicted spectral output (flux) from 1064~nm photons colliding head-on with the $E_e =150$~MeV (kinetic energy) electrons in CBETA; this spectrum was generated using the \textsc{ICCS3D} code, and is consistent with calculations using the method of Sun et al. This spectrum has a peak energy of 403.3~keV; using the proposed 5~degree crossing angle, the peak energy is reduced to 402.5~keV and the spectral density is reduced by a factor $\sim$~5.
