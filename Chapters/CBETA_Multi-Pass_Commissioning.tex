\section{Multi-pass FFA Chromaticity Measurement}

\textcolor{blue}{**AGAIN, JUST GETTING POINTS DOWN HERE** \\ **NOTEBOOK 9 HAS CHROMATICITY NOTES, POSITIONS MARKED BY POST-IT**}

A measurement script has been developed and tested, with experiment during CBETA commissioning, to measure the chromaticity per cell (in both planes) of sections of the CBETA FFA recirculation line, for all 4 turns. Chromaticity per cell $Q'_{x/y}$ can be experimentally measured through measurement of the tune per cell $Q_{x/y}$ as a function of the relative change in momentum of an electron beam $\delta p/p$, as shown in (Eq.~\ref{eq:chromaticity_measurement_central})
\begin{equation}
\Delta Q = Q'\frac{\delta p}{p}.
\label{eq:chromaticity_measurement_central}
\end{equation}
In practice this was accomplished by recursively applying a modified version of an existing script used to measure tune in sections of the FFA whilst incrementing the electron beam energy, thereby changing the electron momentum spread $\Delta p/p$. Firstly, a history of previous ERL chromaticity measurements is presented, then details of this measurement are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:chromaticity_measurement_methodology}, then experimental results are shown in Section~\ref{sec:CBETA_chromaticity_measurement_results}. Finally, the results of this approach are discussed in Section~\ref{sec:chromaticity_discussion}. 

\subsection{ERL Chromaticity Measurements}
\label{sec:ERL_chromaticity_measurements}

Chromaticity measurements within non-scaling FFA transport and for multi-pass ERLs have never been successfully accomplished \textcolor{blue}{**CHECK**}

\subsection{Chromaticity Measurement Methodology}
\label{sec:chromaticity_measurement_methodology}

The energy of a particle after traversing an RF cavity is given by
\begin{equation}
E_{e} = qV_{\mathrm{RF}}\sin\phi_{\mathrm{RF}},
\label{eq:particle_acceleration_energy}
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the charge of the particle (we consider only electrons, $q=e$), $V_{\mathrm{RF}}$ is the maximum RF cavity voltage (generator voltage) and $\phi_{\mathrm{RF}}$ is the RF accelerating phase the electron bunch witnesses. From inspection of (Eq.~\ref{eq:particle_acceleration_energy}), it is possible to vary the energy of the electron bunch in two main ways: by varying the maximum RF cavity voltage or through variation of the accelerating phase. For the chromaticity measurement on CBETA the energy of the electron bunch was manipulated through adjustment of cavity 1 voltage (the cavity traversed last by an accelerated beam). The electron momentum spread is related to the change in RF cavity generator voltage by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta p}{p}\approx \frac{\Delta E_{e}}{E_{e}} = \frac{\Delta V_{\mathrm{RF}}}{V_{\mathrm{RF}}}.    
\end{equation}

To measure the fractional tune per cell of a section of CBETA a vertical or horizontal kick is generated to cause a betatron oscillation which propagates through the FFA common transport return line \cite{gulliford2021measurement}. The vertical kick is provided by the last vertical corrector in the corresponding splitter line of that turn; for example, the 3rd turn vertical kick is provided by the MS3CRV04 vertical corrector. Horizontal kicks are implemented by the last independent dipole magnet (non-septa) in which only a single bunch is traverses the magnet as otherwise betatron oscillations would be generated cumulatively in each effected turn. Quality of orbit kicks in CBETA is also affected by cross-talk between magnets therefore dipole selection is also dependent upon this condition \textcolor{blue}{**IMPROVE THIS SENTENCE**}. For example, the MS2DIP08 dipole is used to induce a horizontal kick in the 78~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 2nd turn.

During chromaticity measurement, each turn is measured independently - only a single kick in a single turn is applied - whilst the energy is varied via the cavity 1 voltage. A viewscreen was placed in the splitter of the consecutive turn to the measured turn in order to prevent the beam from traversing into higher passes. This allowed magnets beyond the measured pass to be turned off, minimizing cross--talk between magnets. However, since the electron bunch is not energy recovered in this measurement only the accelerating bunch may be measured.    

The closed orbit throughout the whole accelerator is modulated via the induced betatron oscillation which is measured by the beam position monitors (BPMs) in the FFA which can detect variation in bunch position in either transverse plane. As per the procedure used in the CBETA fractional arc test \cite{gulliford2019beam} -- a preliminary investigation of FFA transport arcs -- the BPM data is analysed by fitting of a sinusoidal function \textcolor{blue}{**EXPAND - read the technical note on tune measurement**} to produce the betatron phase advance per cell given by
\begin{equation}
\Psi_{x/y}\left(s\right) = \int_{0}^{s}\frac{1}{\beta_{x/y}\left(s\right)}ds,
\label{eq:betatron_phase_advance_per_cell}
\end{equation}
where $s$ is the distance traversed for a single cell in the direction of propagation and $\beta_{x/y}\left(s\right)$ is the $\beta$-function, the amplitude of this oscillation. The betatron phase advance per cell can then be converted into tune per cell via 
\begin{equation}
Q_{x/y} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{s} \frac{1}{\beta_{x/y}\left(s\right)}ds.
\label{eq:tune_definition}
\end{equation}

\subsection{CBETA Chromaticity Measurement Results}
\label{sec:CBETA_chromaticity_measurement_results}

The chromaticity and tune per cell of the FFA can be predicted via \textsc{Opera} fieldmap within \textsc{Bmad} tracking simulations within the CBETA virtual machine. \textcolor{blue}{**CONFIRM WITH KIRSTEN WHERE THIS IS FROM**} Data for BPM positions in the fieldmap tracking virtual machine simulations of the FA/FB arcs and the ZX straight have been made available by the CBETA collaboration. The data set includes the electron beam total energy, the $x$ and $y$ positions of a reference particle at the position of the BPMs and the simulation error associated with this. For the case of these simulations, the BPM positions can be related to the tune by 
\begin{align}
x &= 2\cos\left(2\pi\nu_{x}\right), \\
y &= 2\cos\left(2\pi\nu_{y}\right),
\label{eq:bpm_tune_conversion_fieldmap}
\end{align}
where $x$ ($y$) is the BPM position in $x$ ($y$) plane and $\nu_{x}$ ($\nu_{y}$) is the tune in $x$ ($y$) plane. This is a simplification of the fitting function \cite{gulliford2019beam} used to calculate the tune from BPM measurements upon CBETA.

The plots of the tune per cell in each plane from fieldmap tracking simulations for the CBETA FFA sections (FA/FB arc and ZX straight) and from measured data at the nominal energies of each 4 turns are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fieldmap_chromaticity_tune} for a 40--160~\si{\mega\electronvolt} electron bunch energy range.
\begin{figure}[!h]

Bottom Left: FB arc tune per cell in each transverse plane. }
\label{fig:fieldmap_chromaticity_tune}
\end{figure}

Overall the measured nominal tunes show good agreement with the simulations. However, there are some anomalous points such as the 78~\si{\mega\electronvolt} FA arc $Q_{y}$ tune and the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} FB arc $Q_{y}$ tune. The cause of these discrepancies is though to be the jitter of the accelerator or incorrect tuning of the accelerator optics within those turns.

Upon further inspection of the tune data, where the energy of the electron bunch is varied by up to 0.5\%, it is noted that this energy variation has distorted the orbit of the final 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} 4th turn by an intolerable amount as evidenced by Fig.~\ref{fig:FAFBZX_150_tunes}. The optics in this turn are too sensitive to allow for measurement of the chromaticity in the current configuration.

\begin{figure}[!h]

Top Left: FA arc section. Top Right: FB arc section. Bottom Left: ZX straight section.}
\label{fig:FAFBZX_150_tunes}
\end{figure}

Beyond the first 3 measurements closest to the nominal 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} energy, it is clear in every case that the measured data is erroneous and incomparable with the predictions. On this basis, the 150~\si{\mega\electronvolt} data contradicts the predicted tunes for each of the FFA sections (FA, FB, ZX) and is subsequently discarded from further analysis.

Measurements are further analysed by disregarding any points which are greater than two standard deviations ($2\sigma$) from the mean of the data set. These points are considered anomalous, and by inspection the points labelled anomalous greatly differ from the measured data. These data points may be anomalous due to energy jitter of the linac or peculiarities within the optics configuration used at the time of the measurement. \textcolor{blue}{Needs more work}

The tunes in each plane as a function of electron bunch energy for each of the three remaining turns are presented for the sections of the FFA this measurement has focused upon: FA (Fig.~\ref{fig:FA_analysed_tunes}), FB (Fig.~\ref{fig:FB_analysed_tunes}) and ZX (Fig.~\ref{fig:ZX_analysed_tunes}).

\textcolor{blue}{**TALK ABOUT THE TUNE PLOTS**}

The difference in tune per cell from the tune per cell of the nominal energy is then plotted against the fractional variation in electron bunch total energy compared to the nominal energy. Again, the $2\sigma$ statistical test is applied to categorise any points laying outside of $2\sigma$ as anomalous. A line of best fit is plotted using linear regression of the remaining data points. The gradient of the line of best fit on the plot of $\Delta Q$ as a function of $\Delta E_{e}/E_{e}$ is the chromaticity, as per (Eq.~\ref{eq:chromaticity_measurement_central}). Fig.~\ref{fig:FA_dQdEe}, \ref{fig:FB_dQdEe}, \ref{fig:ZX_dQdEe} present the plots of the tune variation as a function of the fractional electron bunch energy variation for each of the three nominal energy cases (42, 78, 114~\si{\mega\electronvolt}) in each plane ($x$ and $y$).

The chromaticity has been calculated in each plane for each of the three nominal energies using the line of best fit in each plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:FA_dQdEe}, \ref{fig:FB_dQdEe}, \ref{fig:ZX_dQdEe} and these are tabulated in Table~\ref{tab:FAFBZX_measured_chromaticity}. \textcolor{blue}{**TALK ABOUT THE MEASUREMENTS**}

The measured chromaticities are plotted against the predicted chromaticity which is calculated via the derivative of the virtual machine tune--electron bunch energy for each plane and each of the three nominal energies in Fig.~\ref{fig:FAFBZX_chromaticity}.

Top Left: Chromaticity measurement and simulation prediction in both planes through the FA arc. Note: the measured 78~\si{\mega\electronvolt} $Q'_{y}$ point lays outside of the plot range.

\label{fig:FAFBZX_chromaticity}
\end{figure}

The predictions in Fig.~\ref{fig:FAFBZX_chromaticity} show that the chromaticity of each of the sections of the CBETA FFA is expected to be negative throughout the whole energy range of the CBETA operation however, as seen in Table~\ref{tab:FAFBZX_measured_chromaticity}, some measurements show large positive chromaticities such as the 114~\si{\mega\electronvolt} FB arc $Q'_{x} = 2.26$ measurement. Good agreement with the simulated chromaticity is achieved in several measurements for example the 42~\si{\mega\electronvolt} FA arc chromaticities in each plane.   

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:chromaticity_discussion}

Unfortunately, this script was only tested on the last day of operation in the CBETA multi-pass commissioning period. Due to energy drift and jitter in the linac, many tune measurements appear to be distorted. With more data collection on a series of runs the effect of energy drift and linac jitter could be excluded from the data set which could improve the quality of the chromaticity measurement.

The general consistency of the nominal tunes with virtual machine predictions in Fig.~\ref{fig:fieldmap_chromaticity_tune} and the general consistency of the measured and predicted tune per cell variation with electron beam energy in Fig.~\ref{fig:FA_analysed_tunes}, \ref{fig:FB_analysed_tunes}, \ref{fig:ZX_analysed_tunes}, as well as the agreement demonstrated the multi-pass CBETA paper \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}, gives confidence that the existing method of measuring tune is accurate. However, the chromaticity measurement appears to be more sensitive to small changes in energy and measured BPM position. \textcolor{blue}{**I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO SAY**}
