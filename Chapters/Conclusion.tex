\section{Conclusions}
% reference it heavily to the three aims set out in intro
% set out what I have previously done + investigated
    % investigated ICS sources on ERLs via two designs
    % investigated optimisation and characterisation methods
    % investigated their applicability vs other light sources - where are they relevant
    % investigated the applications they are most suited to
% re-iterate main results
    % developed new methods for calculating collimated flux (performance parameter) of ICS + spectrum code, which showed previous col flux methods were insufficient + benchmarked with other spec codes
    % narrow bandwidth radiation requires small emittance, and correctly chosen collimation + spot size at IP + optimised (via 3 methods) to provide best solutions which are non-round (elliptical electron beams at IP), producing tuning curves as common practice for other light sources
    % first pass design of an ICS source for CBETA multi-turn ERL and an applications beamline (other uses)
    % compared with synchrotron sources to show ICS sources become feasible beyond 300 keV
    % designed a gamma ray ICS source for a future conceptual ERL - capable of producing highest demonstrated flux in smallest demoed bandwidth, compared with other radiation production methods to show beneficial by monochromaticity, investigated several potential applications noting the advantages of photonuclear production of medical isotopes

This thesis explores the application of inverse Compton scattering sources to energy recovery linacs via the design of two ERL driven ICS sources: the CBETA ICS source, producing hard x-rays up to 402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} based on the resently commissioned CBETA ERL \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}, and the DIANA ICS source, designed to produce up to 20.11~\si{\mega\electronvolt} from the conceptual DIANA ERL. Several new methodologies have been developed in order to characterise and optimise an ICS source, as presented in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}, based on the theory presented within Chapters~\ref{Energy_Recovery_Linac_Design}, \ref{Photon_Production_by_Inverse_Compton_Scattering}. The developed methods include optimisation methods to optimise the electron beam and collimation parameters at the interaction point for the maximisation of flux and minimisation of bandwidth, an analytical derivation of the collimated flux produced by and ICS source as well as a semi-analytical spectrum code \textsc{ICARUS}. These methods have been applied to both the CBETA ICS source design in Chapter~\ref{CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Scattering_Source_Design} and the DIANA ICS source design in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}.

Within Chapter~\ref{CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Scattering_Source_Design}, the design of an ICS source in the hard x-ray regime is presented, and an ICS beamline design for bypassing the CBETA transport is shown. The designed ICS source is then compared with other x-ray ICS sources and with synchrotron light sources. Finally, a set of possible applications of such a high flux, narrowband hard x-ray source are explored. Similarly, the design of a $\gamma$-ray ICS source upon the conceptual DIANA ERL is presented in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}, where first-pass design parameters are presented and spectral output is predicted. The DIANA ICS source is compared to other ICS sources and the bremsstrahlung method of $\gamma$-ray production. Suitable applications of a narrowband, high flux $\gamma$-ray source are then investigated, with focus on nuclear resonance fluorescence and photonuclear medical isotope production. Consequently, the material presented in the preceding chapters has satisfied the scope of the investigation outlined in Section~\ref{sec:thesis_layout_scope}: to investigate possible ERL based ICS source configurations and compare these with other accelerator types, their optimum configuration for production of high flux, narrowband radiation and evaluate their most fitting applications in the context of other accelerator light sources.

% no need for monochromation - simple collimation
% recipe for good ICS source (emittance, current, shot bunch etc.)
% results from methods (elliptical beam best, other collimated flux methods deficient)

The results of the CBETA ICS source investigation have shown that ICS sources are capable of out-performing (in terms of flux and average brilliance) synchrotron light sources beyond 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{}. Bandwidths  of 0.5\% \textit{rms} are possible for the CBETA ICS source, narrower than the designed or demonstrated bandwidth of any ICS source. The CBETA ICS source is also capabale of higher flux than other previously demonstrated ICS sources, as shown in Table~\ref{}, demonstrating that the multi-turn ERL approach, with reasonable laser and optical cavity specifications, is a good approach to high flux, narrow bandwidth ICS sources. 

Design of the DIANA ICS source has shown that a high flux of up to ... is possible, with ... in a narrow 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art ELI-NP-GBS \cite{elinp2019vega,tanaka2020current} ICS source and could out-perform the current highest flux demonstration HI$\gamma$S \cite{weller2009research} by two orders of magnitude, as seen in Table~\ref{tab:}. Comparison with bremsstrahlung sources has shown that, whilst bremsstrahlung exceeds ICS sources in terms of flux, the continuous nature of the bremsstrahlung spectrum and monochromation requirements mean bremsstrahlung is a more challenging method to utilise. Finally, investigation of medical isotopes has shown that for a test case of 153 Samarium production, the DIANA ICS source is estimated to produce specific activies of around ... whilst yielding advantages in shelf-life because no 154 Samarium impurities arise in the photonuclear route.
