This thesis explores the application of inverse Compton scattering sources to energy recovery linacs via the design of two ERL driven ICS sources: the CBETA ICS source, producing hard x-rays up to 402.5~\si{\kilo\electronvolt} based on the recently commissioned CBETA ERL \cite{bartnik2020cbeta}, and the DIANA ICS source, designed to produce up to 20.11~\si{\mega\electronvolt} $\gamma$-rays from the conceptual DIANA ERL. Several new methodologies have been developed in order to characterise and optimise an ICS source, as presented in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}, based on the theory presented within Chapters~\ref{Energy_Recovery_Linac_Design}, \ref{Photon_Production_by_Inverse_Compton_Scattering}. The developed methods include optimisation methods to optimise the electron beam and collimation parameters at the interaction point for the maximisation of flux and minimisation of bandwidth, an analytical derivation of the collimated flux produced by and ICS source as well as a semi-analytical spectrum code \textsc{ICARUS}. These methods have been applied to both the CBETA ICS source design in Chapter~\ref{CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Scattering_Source_Design} and the DIANA ICS source design in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}.

Within Chapter~\ref{CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Scattering_Source_Design}, the design of an ICS source in the hard x-ray regime is presented, and an ICS beamline design for bypassing the CBETA transport is shown. The designed ICS source is then compared with other x-ray ICS sources and with synchrotron light sources. Finally, a set of possible applications of a high flux, narrowband hard x-ray source like the CBETA ICS source are explored. Similarly, the design of a $\gamma$-ray ICS source upon the conceptual DIANA ERL is presented in Chapter~\ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design}, where first-pass design parameters are presented and spectral output is predicted. The DIANA ICS source is compared to other ICS sources and the bremsstrahlung method of $\gamma$-ray production. Suitable applications of a narrowband, high flux $\gamma$-ray source are then investigated, with focus on nuclear resonance fluorescence and photonuclear medical isotope production. Consequently, the material presented in the preceding chapters has satisfied the scope of the investigation outlined in Section~\ref{sec:thesis_layout_scope}: to investigate possible ERL based ICS source configurations and compare these with other accelerator types, to find the optimum configuration for production of high flux, narrowband radiation and to evaluate the most fitting applications for ERL drive ICS sources in the context of other accelerator light sources.

As shown in Chapters~\ref{Photon_Production_by_Inverse_Compton_Scattering} and\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra}, ICS sources alleviate the requirement of monochromators necessary for narrow bandwidth in other accelerator driven light sources such as synchrotron light sources because the scattered photon energy of an ICS source is inversely proportional to the scattering angle and monochromation is achieved via simple collimation. It can also be noted that high average beam current, small emittance and a small interaction spot size of the electron bunch are crucial for high flux, narrowband ICS sources. An ERL electron beam can provide all of these as evidenced by the ICS source designs in Chapters~\ref{CBETA_Inverse_Compton_Scattering_Source_Design} and \ref{DIANA_Inverse_Compton_Source_Design} however, other approaches such as non-equilibrium or low emittance storage rings can also provide similar parameters; further investigation is required to determine if ERLs are the ideal accelerator choice for ICS sources. 

A spectrum code \textsc{ICARUS} has been developed in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra} and benchmarked against the \textsc{ICCS3D} spectrum code for several cases in Figs.~\ref{fig:ICARUS_optimised_benchmarking} and \ref{fig:CBETA_spectrum_benchmarking} with good agreement shown throughout. The analytical collimated flux calculation derived in Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra} has been shown to be consistent with the \textsc{ICARUS} semi-analytical spectrum code also developed in this chapter due to the agreement in Fig.~\ref{fig:curatolo_collimated_flux_comparison}, which also shows the calculation of Curatolo et al \cite{curatolo2017analytical} is deficient. Chapter~\ref{Optimisation_and_Characterisation_of_Inverse_Compton Scattering_Spectra} also demonstrates that the bandwidth and collimated flux of an ICS source can be improved by proper trade-off of the collimation angle and $\beta$-functions (spot size) of the electron bunch at the interaction point. For a narrow 0.5\% bandwidth, up to 40\% increase in collimated flux has been demonstrated using this optimisation as shown in Table~\ref{tab:collimated_flux_calculations}. An elliptical spot size of the electron bunch at the IP is typically favoured, as evidenced by Table~\ref{tab:single_point_optimisations} and Figs.~\ref{fig:case_A_optimisation_comparison}, \ref{fig:case_B_optimisation_comparison} and \ref{fig:case_C_optimisation_comparision}, because of the crossing angle imposed between the electron bunch and the counter-propagating laser pulse. The transverse spot size of the electron bunch should also be smaller than that of the laser pulse because, with typical conventional lasers, the photon density of the laser pulse is much larger than the electron bunch so the $\sigma_{L}>\sigma_{e}$ configuration increases the flux of an ICS source. 

The results of the CBETA ICS source investigation have shown that ICS sources are capable of out-performing (in terms of flux and average brilliance) synchrotron light sources beyond 300~\si{\kilo\electronvolt}, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ICS_vs_SPRING8_Undulator_Flux}. Bandwidths of 0.5\% \textit{rms} are possible for the CBETA ICS source, narrower than the designed or demonstrated bandwidth of any ICS source, whilst maintaining high flux and average brilliance as shown in Table~\ref{CBETA_spectral_output}. Table~\ref{tab:xray_ICS_comparison} shows the CBETA ICS source is also capable of higher flux than other previously demonstrated ICS sources, demonstrating that the multi-turn ERL approach, with reasonable laser and optical cavity specifications, is a good approach to high flux, narrow bandwidth ICS sources. With an adjustable collimator system (or set of collimators) and the variable final focus of the ICS bypass the collimated flux and bandwidth of the CBETA ICS source are tunable to experimental requirements, as demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:CBETA_Tuning_Curve}   

Design of the DIANA ICS source has shown that $\gamma$-rays with a maximum energy of 20.11~\si{\mega\electronvolt} can be produced with a high flux of up to $6.08\times 10^{10}$~ph/\si{\second} is possible, where $1.30\times 10^{9}$~ph/\si{\second} are generated in a narrow 0.5\% \textit{rms} bandwidth, as presented in Table~\ref{fig:DIANA_spectral_output}. Table~\ref{tab:gammaray_ICS_comparison} shows the maximum flux of the DIANA ICS source is comparable to the state-of-the-art ELI-NP-GBS \cite{elinp2019vega,tanaka2020current} ICS source and could out-perform the current highest flux demonstration HI$\gamma$S \cite{weller2009research} by two orders of magnitude. Comparison with bremsstrahlung sources has shown that, whilst bremsstrahlung exceeds ICS sources in terms of flux, the continuous nature of the bremsstrahlung spectrum and monochromation requirements mean bremsstrahlung is a more challenging method to utilise. Finally, investigation of medical isotopes has shown that for a test case of 153 Samarium production, the DIANA ICS source is estimated to produce specific activities of around 60--70~\si{\mega\becquerel}/\si{\milli\gram} with shelf-life advantages because no 154 Samarium impurities arise in the photonuclear route.
